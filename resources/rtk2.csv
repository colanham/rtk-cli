kanji,english,explanation,primitive
一,one,"In Chinese characters, the number **one** is laid on its side, unlike the Roman numeral I which stands upright. As you would expect, it is written from left to right.","* As a primitive element, the key-word meaning is discarded, and the single horizontal stroke takes on the meaning of _floor_ or _ceiling_ , depending on its position: if it stands above another primitive, it means _ceiling_ , if below, _floor_."
二,two,"Like the Roman numeral II, which reduplicates the numeral I, the kanji for **two** is a simple reduplication of the horizontal stroke that means one. The order of writing goes from above to below, with the first stroke slightly shorter.",
三,three,"And like the Roman numeral III, which triples the numeral I, the kanji for **three** simply triples the single horizontal stroke. In writing it, think of ""1 + 2 = 3"" (一 + 二 = 三) in order to keep the middle stroke shorter.",
四,four,"This character is composed of two primitive elements, _mouth_ and _human legs_ , both of which we will meet in the coming lessons. Assuming that you already knew how to write this kanji, we will pass over the ""story"" connected with it until later. Note how the second stroke is written left-to-right and then top- to-bottom. This is consistent with what we have already seen in the first three numbers and leads us to a general principle that will be helpful when we come to more complicated kanji later on: write north-to-south, west-to-east, northwest-to-southeast.",
五,five,"As with _four_ , we shall postpone learning the primitive elements that make up this character. Note how the general principle we just learned in the preceding frame applies to the writing of the character for **five**.",
六,six,"The primitives here are _top hat_ and _animal legs_. Once again, we glide over them until later.",
七,seven,"Note that the first stroke ""cuts"" through the second. This distinguishes **seven** from the character for _spoon_  (Frame 476), in which the horizontal stroke stops short.","* As a primitive, this form takes on the meaning of _diced_ , i.e., ""cut"" into little pieces, consistent both with the way the character is written and with its association with the kanji for _cut_ to be learned in a later lesson (Frame 89)."
八,eight,"Just as the Arabic numeral ""8"" is composed of a small circle followed by a larger one, so the kanji for **eight** is composed of a short line followed by a longer line, slanting towards it but not touching it. And just as the  ""lazy 8"" is the mathematical symbol for ""infinity,"" so the expanse opened up below these two strokes is associated by the Japanese with the sense of an infinite expanse or something ""all-encompassing.""",
九,nine,"If you take care to remember the stroke order of this kanji, you will not have trouble later keeping it distinct from the kanji for _power_ (Frame 922).","* As a primitive, we shall use this kanji to mean _baseball team_ or simply _baseball_. The meaning, of course, is derived from the _nine_ players who make up a team."
十,ten,Turn this character 45 degrees either way and you have the x used for the Roman numeral **ten**.,"* As a primitive, this character sometimes keeps its meaning of _ten_ and sometimes signifies _needle_ , this latter derived from the kanji for _needle_ (Frame 292). Since the primitive is used in the kanji itself, there is no need to worry about confusing the two. In fact, we shall be following this procedure regularly."
口,mouth,"Like several of the first characters we shall learn, the kanji for **mouth** is a clear pictograph. Since there are no circular shapes in the kanji, the square must be used to depict the circle.","* As a primitive, this form also means _mouth_. Any of the range of possible images that the word suggests - an opening or entrance to a cave, a river, a bottle, or even the largest hole in your head - can be used for the primitive meaning."
日,day,"This kanji is intended to be a pictograph of the sun. Recalling what we said in the previous frame about round forms, it is easy to detect the circle and the big smile that characterize our simplest drawings of the sun - like those yellow badges with the words, ""Have a nice **day**! ""","* Used as a primitive, this kanji can mean _sun_ or _day_ or a _tongue wagging in the mouth_. This latter meaning, incidentally, derives from an old character outside the standard list meaning something like  ""sayeth"" and written almost exactly the same, except that the stroke in the middle does not touch the right side (Frame 620)."
月,month,"This character is actually a picture of the moon, with the two horizontal lines representing the left eye and mouth of the mythical ""man in the moon."" (Actually, the Japanese see a hare in the moon, but it is a little farfetched to find one in the kanji.) And one **month** , of course, is one cycle of the moon.","* As a primitive element, this character can take on the sense of _moon_ , _flesh_ , or _part of the body_. The reasons for the latter two meanings will be explained in a later chapter."
田,rice field,"Another pictograph, this kanji looks like a bird's-eye view of a **rice field** divided into four plots. Be careful when writing this character to get the order of the strokes correct. You will find that it follows perfectly the principle stated in frame 4.","* When used as a primitive element, the meaning of _rice field_ is most common, but now and again it will take the meaning of _brains_ from the fact that it looks a bit like that tangle of gray matter nestled under our skulls."
目,eye,"Here again, if we round out the corners of this kanji and curve the middle strokes upwards and downwards respectively, we get something resembling an **eye**.","* As a primitive, the kanji keeps its sense of _eye_ , or more specifically, an _eyeball_. When placed in the surroundings of a complex kanji, the primitive will sometimes be turned on its side."
古,old,"The primitive elements that compose this character are _ten_ and _mouth_ , but you may find it easier to remember it as a pictograph of a tombstone with a cross on top. Just think back to one of those graveyards you have visited, or better still, used to play in as a child, with **old** inscriptions on the tombstones. This departure from the primitive elements in favor of a pictograph will take place now and again at these early stages, and almost never after that. So you need not worry about cluttering up your memory with too many character  ""drawings.""","* Used as a primitive element, this kanji keeps its key-word sense of _old_ , but care should be taken to make that abstract notion as graphic as possible."
吾,I,"There are actually a number of kanji for the word **I** , but the others tend to be more specific than this one. The key word here should be taken in the general psychological sense of the ""perceiving subject."" Now the one place in our bodies that all _five_ senses are concentrated in is the head, which has no less than _five mouths_ : 2 nostrils, 2 ears, and 1 mouth. Hence, _five mouths_ = **I**.",
冒,risk,"Remember when you were young and your mother told you never to look directly into the _sun_ for fear you might burn out your _eyes_? Probably you were foolish enough to **risk** a quick glance once or twice, but just as probably, you passed that bit of folk wisdom on to someone else as you grew older. Here, too, the kanji that has a _sun_ above and an _eye_ right below looking up at it has the meaning of **risk** (see frame 12).",
朋,companion,"The first **companion** that God made, as the Bible story goes, was Eve. Upon seeing her, Adam exclaimed,  "" _Flesh_ of my _flesh_! "" And that is precisely what this character says in so many strokes.",
明,bright,"Among nature's **bright** lights, there are two that the biblical myth has God set in the sky: the _sun_ to rule over the day and the _moon_ to rule the night. Each of them has come to represent one of the common connotations of this key word: the _sun_ , the **bright** insight of the clear thinker, and the _moon_ , the **bright** intuition of the poet and the seer (see frame 13).",
唱,chant,"This one is easy! You have one _mouth_ making no noise (the choirmaster) and two _mouths with wagging tongues_ (the minimum for a chorus). So think of the key word, **chant** , as monastery singing and the kanji is yours forever (see frame 11).",
晶,sparkle,"What else can the word **sparkle** suggest if not a diamond? And if you've ever held a diamond up to the light, you will have noticed how every facet of it becomes like a miniature _sun_. This kanji is a picture of a tiny _sun_ in three places (that is,  ""everywhere""), to give the sense of something that **sparkles** on all sides. Just like a diamond. In writing the primitive elements three times, note again how the rule for writing given in frame 4 holds true not only for the strokes in each individual element but also for the disposition of the elements in the character as a whole.",
品,goods,"As in the character for _sparkle_ , the triplication of a single element in this character indicates ""everywhere"" or ""heaps of."" When we think of **goods** in modern industrial society, we think of what has been mass- produced - that is to say, produced for the  ""masses"" of open _mouths_ waiting like fledglings in a nest to  ""consume"" whatever comes their way.",
呂,spine,This character is rather like a picture of two of the vertebrae in the **spine** linked by a single stroke.,
昌,prosperous,"What we mentioned in the previous two frames about 3 of something meaning ""everywhere"" or ""heaps of"" was not meant to be taken lightly. In this kanji we see _two suns_ , one atop the other, which, if we are not careful, is easily confused in memory with the _three suns_ of _sparkle_. Focus on the number this way: since we speak of **prosperous** times as _sunny_ , what could be more **prosperous** than a sky with _two suns_ in it? Just be sure to actually SEE them there.",
早,early,"This kanji is actually a picture of the first flower of the day, which we shall, in defiance of botanical science, call the _sun_ flower, since it begins with the element for _sun_ and is held upon a stem with leaves (the pictographic representation of the final two strokes). This time, however, we shall ignore the pictograph and imagine _sun_ flowers with _needles_ for stems, which can be plucked and used to darn your socks. The sense of **early** is easily remembered if one thinks of the _sun_ flower as the **early** riser in the garden, because the _sun_ , showing favoritism towards its namesake, shines on it before all the others (see frame 10).","* As a primitive element, this kanji takes the meaning of _sunflower_ , which was used to make the abstract key word _early_ more graphic."
旭,rising sun,"This character is a sort of nickname for the Japanese flag with its well-known emblem of the **rising sun**. If you can picture two seams running down that great red _sun_ , and then imagine it sitting on a _baseball_ bat for a flagpole, you have a slightly irreverent - but not altogether inaccurate - picture of how the sport has caught on in the Land of the **Rising Sun**.",
世,generation,"We generally consider one **generation** as a period of thirty (or _ten_ plus _ten_ plus _ten_ ) years. If you look at this kanji in its completed form - not in its stroke order - you will see three _tens_. When writing it, think of the lower horizontal lines as  ""addition"" lines written under numbers to add them up. Thus: _ten_ ""plus"" _ten_ ""plus"" _ten_ = thirty. Actually, it's a lot easier doing it with a pencil than reading it in a book.",
胃,stomach,"You will need to refer back to frames 13 and 14 here for the special meaning of the two primitive elements that make up this character: _flesh_ ( _part of the body_ ) and _brain_. What the kanji says, if you look at it, is that the _part of the body_ that keeps the _brain_ in working order is the **stomach**. To keep the elements in proper order, when you write this kanji think of the _brain_ as being  ""held up"" by the _flesh_.",
旦,nightbreak,"While we normally refer to the start of the day as ""daybreak,"" Japanese commonly refers to it as the ""opening up of night"" into day. Hence the choice of this rather odd key word, **nightbreak**. The single stroke at the bottom represents the _floor_ (have a peek again at frame 1) or the horizon over which the _sun_ is poking its head",
胆,gall bladder,"The pieces in this character should be easily recognizable: on the left, the element for _part of the body_ , and on the right, the character for _nightbreak_ , which we have just met. What all of this has to do with the **gall bladder** is not immediately clear. But all we need to do is give a slight twist to the traditional biblical advice about not letting the sun set on your anger (which ancient medicine associated with the choler or bile that the **gall bladder** is supposed to filter out), and change it to  ""not letting the _night break_ on your anger "" (or your **gall** ) - and the work of remembering the kanji is done. And the improvement is not a bad piece of advice in its own right, since anger, like so many other things, can often be calmed by letting the sun set on it and then ""sleeping it off.""",
亘,span,"Sunrise, sunset, sunrise, sunset... goes the song of the Fiddler on the Roof. You can almost see the journey of the sun as it moves from one horizon (the _floor_ ) to its noonday heights in the sky overhead ( _ceiling_ ) and then disappears over the other horizon - day after day, marking the **span** of our lives.",
凹,concave,"You couldn't have asked for a better key word for this kanji! Just have a look at it: a perfect image of a **concave** lens (remembering, of course, that the kanji square off rounded things), complete with its own little  ""cave."" Now all you have to do is learn how to write it.",
凸,convex,"Maybe this helps you see how the Japanese have no trouble keeping **convex** distinct from _concave_. Note the odd feeling of the third stroke. If it doesn't feel all that strange now, by the time you are done with this book, it will. There are very few times you will have to write it.",
旧,olden times,"A _walking stick_ is needed for _days_ of **olden times** , since _days_ , too, get old - at least insofar as we refer to them as the ""good old days."" The main thing here is to think of ""good old days"" when you hear the key word **olden times**. The rest will take care of itself.",
自,oneself,"You can think of this kanji as a stylized pictograph of the nose, that little _drop_ that Mother Nature set between your _eyes_. The Japanese refer to themselves by pointing a finger at their nose - giving us an easy way to remember the kanji for **oneself**.","* The same meaning of _oneself_ can be kept when this kanji is used as a primitive element, but you will generally find it better to give it the meaning of _nose_ or _nostrils_ , both because it accords with the story above and because it is the first part of the kanji for _nose_ (Frame 733)."
白,white,"The color **white** is a mixture of all the primary colors, both for pigments and for light, as we see when a prism breaks up the rays of the sun. Hence, a single _drop_ of _sun_ spells **white**.","* As a primitive, this character can either retain its meaning of _white_ or take the more graphic meaning of a _white bird_ or _dove_. This latter stems from the fact that it appears at the top of the kanji for _bird_ , which we shall get to later (Frame 2091)."
百,hundred,"The Japanese refer to a person's 99th birthday as a "" _white_ year "" because _white_ is the kanji you are left with if you subtract _one_ from a **hundred**.",
中,in,"The elements here are a _walking stick_ and a _mouth_. Remember the trouble your mother had getting medicine **in** your _mouth_? Chances are it crossed her mind more than once to grab something handy, like your grandfather's _walking stick_ , to pry open your jaws while she performed her duty. Keep the image of getting something **in** from the outside, and the otherwise abstract sense of this key word should be a lot easier than trying to spoon castor oil **in** to a baby's mouth.",
千,thousand,"This kanji is almost too simple to pull apart, but for the sake of practice, have a look at the _drop_ above and the _ten_ below. Now put the elements together by thinking of squeezing two more zeros out of an _eyedropper_ alongside the number _ten_ to make it a **thousand**.",
舌,tongue,"The primitive for _mouth_ and the character for _thousand_ naturally form the idea of **tongue** if one thinks of a _thousand mouths_ able to speak the same language, or as we say,  ""sharing a common **tongue**. "" It is easy to see the connection between the idiom and the kanji if you take its image literally: a single **tongue** being passed around from _mouth_ to _mouth_.",
升,measuring box,"This is the character for the little wooden box that the Japanese use for measuring things, as well as for drinking saké out of. Simply imagine the outside as spiked with a _thousand_ sharp _needles_ , and the quaint little **measuring box** becomes a drinker's nightmare! Be very careful when you write this character not to confuse it with the writing of _thousand_. The reason for the difference gives us a chance to clarify another general principle of writing that supersedes the one we mentioned in frame 4: when a single stroke runs vertically through the middle of a character, it is written last.",
昇,rise up,"Our image here is made up of two primitive elements: a _sun_ and a _measuring box_. Just as the _sun_ can be seen **rising up** in the morning from - where else - the Land of the Rising Sun, this kanji has the _sun_ **rising up** out of a Japanese _measuring box_  \- the "" _measuring box_ of the **rising-up** _sun_. """,
丸,round,"We speak of "" **round** numbers, "" or "" **rounding** a number off, "" meaning to add an insignificant amount to bring it to the nearest 10. For instance, if you add just a wee bit, the tiniest _drop_ , to _nine_ , you end up with a **round** number.","* As a primitive, this element takes the meaning of a _fat man_. Think of a grotesquely _fat man_ whose paunch so covers the plate that he is always getting hit by the pitch. Hence a _round baseball player_ becomes a _fat man_."
寸,measurement,"This kanji actually stood for a small **measurement** used prior to the metric system, a bit over an inch in length, and from there acquired the sense of **measurement**. In the old system, it was one- _tenth_ of a _shaku_ (whose kanji we shall meet in frame 1151). The picture, appropriately, represents one _drop_ of a _ten_  (with a hook!).","* As a primitive, we shall use this to mean _glue_ or _glued to_. There is no need to devise a story to remember this, since the primitive will appear so often you would have to struggle hard NOT to remember it."
肘,elbow,"Instead of the familiar ""grease"" we usually associate with the **elbow** of someone hard at work, the kanji gives us a _part of the body_ that has been _glued to_ its task.",
専,specialty,"_Ten_ . . . _rice fields_ . . . _glue_. That is how one would read the primitive elements of this kanji from top to bottom. Now if we make a simple sentence out of these elements, we get:  "" _Ten rice fields glued_ together. "" A **specialty** , of course, refers to one's special "" _field_ "" of endeavor or competence. In fact, few people remain content with a single **specialty** and usually extend themselves in other _fields_ as well. This is how we come to get the picture of _ten fields glued_ together to represent a **specialty**.",
博,Dr.,"At the left we have the _needle_ , at the right, the kanji for _specialty_ , plus an extra _drop_ at the top. Think of a **Dr.** who is a _specialist_ with a _needle_ (an acupuncturist) and let the _drop_ at the top represent the period at the end of **Dr.** In principle we are trying to avoid this kind of device, which plays on abstract grammatical conventions, but I think you will agree, after you have had occasion to use the right side of this kanji in forming other kanji, that the exception is merited in this case.",* The primitive form of this kanji eliminates the _needle_ on the left and gets the meaning of an _acupuncturist_.
占,fortune-telling,"This is one of those kanji that is a real joy of simplicity: a _divining rod_ with a _mouth_  \- which translate directly into **fortune-telling**. Note how the movement from top to bottom (the movement in which the kanji are written) is also the order of the elements which make up our story and of the key word itself: first _divining rod_ , then _mouth_. This will not always be possible, but where it is, memory has almost no work at all to do.",
上,above,"The two directions, **above** and below, are usually pointed at with the finger. But the characters do not follow that custom, so we have to choose something else, easily remembered. The primitives show a _magic wand_ standing **_above_** a _floor_  \- ""magically,"" you might say. Anyway, go right on to the next frame, since the two belong together and are best remembered as a unit, just as the words **above** and _below_ suggest each other.",
下,below,"Here we see our famous miraculous _magic wand_ hanging, all on its own, **below** the _ceiling_ , as you probably already guessed would happen. In addition to giving us two new kanji, the two shapes given in this and the preceding frame also serve to fix the use of the primitives for _ceiling_ and _floor_ , by drawing our attention successively to the line standing above and **below** the primitive element to which it is related.",
卓,eminent,The word **eminent** suggests a famous or well-known person. So all you need to do - given the primitives of a _magic wand_ and a _sunflower_  \- is to think of the world's most **eminent** magician as one who uses a _sunflower_ for a _magic wand_ (like a flower-child who goes around turning the world into peace and love).,
朝,morning,"On the right we see the _moon_ fading off into the first light of **morning** , and to the left, the _mist_ that falls to give nature a shower to prepare it for the coming heat. If you can think of the _moon_ tilting over to spill _mist_ on your garden, you should have no trouble remembering which of all the elements in this story are to serve as primitives for constructing the character.",
嘲,derision,"The bad feeling created by words spoken in **derision** often leaves a bad taste in the _mouth_ of the one who speaks them, kind of like the foul aftertaste that follows a night before of too much of the wrong stuff - or what we call _morning mouth_.",
只,only,"When we run across abstract key words like this one, the best way to get an image it to recall some common but suggestive phrase in which the word appears. For instance, we can think of the expression ""it's the **only** one of its kind. "" Then we imagine a barker at a side-show advertising some strange pac-manlike creature he has inside his tent, with only a gigantic _mouth_ and two wee _animal legs_.",
貝,shellfish,"To remember the primitive elements that make up this kanji, an _eye_ and _animal legs_ , you might be tempted to think of it as a pictograph of a **shellfish** with its ridged shell at the top and two little _legs_ sticking out of the bottom. But that might not help you recall later just how many ridges to put on the shell. Better to imagine a freakish **shellfish** with a single, gigantic _eye_ roaming the beaches on its slender little _legs_ , scaring the wits out of the sunbathers.","* When used as a primitive, in addition to _shells_ , the meanings _oyster_ and _clam_ will often come in handy."
唄,pop song,"There is a lot of money to be made of one's **songs** are  "" **pop** ular."" This is depicted here as a stream of _clams_ spewing out of the _mouth_ of someone performing a **pop song**.",
貞,upright,"Now take the last primitive, the _shellfish_ , and set a _magic wand_ over it, and you have the kanji for **upright**. After all, the _clam_ and the _oyster_ are incapable of walking **upright**. It would take a magician with his _wand_ to pull off such a feat - which is precisely what we have in this kanji.",
員,employee,"How do we get a _mouth_ over a _shellfish_ to mean an **employee**? Simple. Just remember the advice new **employees** get about keeping their _mouths_ shut and doing their job, and then make that more graphic by picturing an office building full of white collar workers scurrying around with _clams_ pinched to their _mouths_.",
貼,post a bill,"The key word in this frame has do with **posting bills** to a billboard. In this case, the billboard is standing at the exit to a Chinese restaurant displaying the latest alternative to the tradition _fortune-telling_ cookies. Look closely and you will see rows of leftover shells of _clams_ with little slips of paper sticking out of them **posted** to the billboard.",
見,see,"The elements that compose the character for **see** are the _eye_ firmly fixed to a pair of _human legs_. Surely, somewhere in your experience, there is a vivid image just waiting to be dragged up to help you remember this character....",
児,newborn babe,"The top part of the kanji in this frame, you will remember, is the character for _olden times_ , those _days_ so old they needed a _walking stick_ to get around. Western mythical imagination has old  ""Father Time"" leaning on his sickle with a **newborn babe** crawling around his _legs_ , the idea being that the circle of birth and-death goes on. This is the first of three times that the kanji for _olden times_ will appear as a primitive element in another kanji, so try to make the most of it.",
元,beginning,"In the **beginning**...  starts that marvelous shelf of books we call the Bible. It talks about how all things were made, and tells us that when the Creator came to humanity she made _two_ of them, man and woman. While we presume she made _two_ of every other animal as well, we are not told as much. Hence we need only   _two_ and a pair of _human legs_ come to the kanji that means **beginning**.",
頁,page,"What we have to do here is turn a _shellfish_ into a **page** of a book. The _one_ at the top tells us that we only get a rather short book, in fact only _one_ **page**. Imagine a title printed on the shell of an _oyster_ , let us say ""Pearl of Wisdom,"" and then open the quaint book to its _one_ and only **page** , on which you find a single, radiant _drop of_ wisdom, one of the masterpiece poems of nature.","* As a primitive, this kanji takes the unrelated meaning of a _head_ (preferably one detached from its body), derived from the character for _head_ (Frame 1549)."
頑,stubborn,"This character refers to the block _headed_ , persistent **stubbornness** of one who sticks to an idea or a plan just the way it was at the _beginning_ , without letting anything that comes up along the way alter things in the least. The explanation makes ""sense,"" but is hard to remember because the word "" _beginning_ ""is too abstract. Back up to the image we used two frames ago - Adam and Eve in their Eden - and try again: The root of all **stubbornness** goes back to the _beginning_ , with two brothers each **stubbornly** defending his own way of life and asking their God to bless it favorably. Abel stuck to agriculture, Cain to animal-raising. Picture these two with their giant, swelled _heads_ , each vying for the favors of heaven, a **stubborn** grimace on their faces. No wonder something unfortunate happened!",
凡,mediocre,"While we refer to something insignificant as a "" _drop_ in the bucket, "" the kanji for **mediocre** suggests the image of a  "" _drop_ in the _wind_. """,
負,defeat,"Above we have the condensed form of _bound up_ , and below the familiar _shellfish_. Now imagine two _oysters_ engaged in _shell_ -to- _shell_ combat, the one who is **defeated** being _bound and gagged_ with seaweed, the victor towering triumphantly over it. The _bound shellfish_ thus becomes the symbol for **defeat**.",
万,ten thousand,"Japanese counts higher numbers in units of **ten thousand** , unlike the West, which advances according to units of one thousand. (Thus, for instance, 40,000 would be read ""four **ten-thousands** "" by a Japanese.) Given that the comma is used in larger numbers to _bind up_ a numerical unit of one thousand, the elements for _one_ and _bound up_ naturally come to form **ten thousand**. The order of strokes here needs special attention, both because it falls outside the general principles we have learned already, and because it involves writing the element for _bound up_ in an order opposite to the one we learned. If it is any consolation, this exception is consistent every time these three strokes come together.",
句,phrase,"By combining the two primitives _bound up_ and _mouth_ , we can easily see how this character can get the meaning of a **phrase**. After all, a **phrase** is nothing more than a number of words _bound up_ tightly and neatly so that they will fit in your _mouth_.",
肌,texture,"Ever notice how the **texture** of your face and hands is affected by the _wind_? A day's skiing or sailing makes them rough and dry, and in need of a good soft cream to soothe the burn. So whenever a _part of the body_ gets exposed to the _wind_ , its **texture** is affected. (If it is any help, the Latin word hiding inside **texture** connotes how something is  ""to the touch."")",
旬,decameron,"There simply is not a good phrase in English for the block often days which this character represents. So we resurrect the classical phrase, **decameron** , whose connotations the tales of Boccaccio have done much to enrich. Actually, it refers to a journey of ten _days_ taken by a band of people - that is, a group of people _bound together_ for the _days_ of the **decameron**.",
勺,ladle,"If you want to _bind up drops_ of anything - water, soup, lemonade - you use something to scoop these _drops_ up, which is what we call a **ladle**. See the last _drop_ left inside the **ladle**?",
的,bull´s eye,"The elements _white bird_ and _ladle_ easily suggest the image of a **bull's eye** if you imagine a rusty old _ladle_ with a **bull's eye** painted on it in the form of a tiny _white bird_ , who lets out a little ""peep"" every time you hit the target.",
首,neck,"Reading this kanji from the top down, we have: _horns_ . . . _nose_. Together they bring to mind the picture of a moose-head hanging on the den wall, with its great _horns_ and long _nose_. Now while we would speak of cutting off a moose's  ""head"" to hang on the wall, the Japanese speak of cutting off its **neck**. It's all a matter of how you look at it. Anyway, if you let the word **neck** conjure up the image of a moose with a very l-o-n-g **neck** hanging over the fireplace, whose _horns_ you use for a coat-rack and whose _nose_ has spigots left and right for scotch and water, you should have no trouble with the character. Here we get a good look at what we mentioned when we first introduced the element for _horns_ : that they can never be left floating free and require an extra horizontal stroke to prevent that from happening, as is the case here.",
乙,fish guts,"The kanji shown here actually represents the ""second"" position in the old Chinese zodiac, which the Japanese still use as an alternate way of enumeration, much the same way that English will revert to Roman numerals. Among its many other meanings are ""pure,"" ""tasteful,"" ""quaint,"" and - get this! - **fish guts**. Since it is a pictograph of a fishhook, it should not be hard to associate it with the key word.","* We will keep _fishhook_ as the primitive meaning. Its shape will rarely be quite the same as that of the kanji. When it appears at the bottom of another primitive, it is straightened out, almost as if the weight of the upper element had bent it out of shape. And when it appears to the right of another element, the short horizontal line that gets the shape started is omitted and it is stretched out and narrowed, all for reasons of space and aesthetics. Examples follow."
乱,riot,"In a **riot** , manners are laid aside and tempers get short, even in so courtesy-conscious a land as Japan. This kanji shows what happens to a **rioting** _tongue_ : it gets ""barbed"" like a _fishhook_ , and sets to attacking the opposition, to _hook_ them as it were.",
直,straightaway,"Begin with the top two primitives, _needle_ and _eye_. Together they represent the _eye of a needle_. Below them is a _fishhook_ that has been **straightened out** and its barb removed so that it can pass through the _eye of the needle_.",
具,tool,"Here is the full kanji on which the last frame is based. If you can think of a table full of carpenter's **tools** of all sorts, each equipped with its own _eye_ so that it can keep a watch over what you are doing with it, you won't have trouble later keeping the primitive and the kanji apart.",
真,TRUE,"Here again we meet the composite element, _eye of the needle_ , which here combines with _tool_ to give us a measure of what is **true** and what is not.",
工,craft,"The pictograph of an I beam, like the kind used in heavy construction work on buildings and bridges, gives us the character for **craft** in general.","* As a primitive element, the key word retains the meaning of _craft_ and also takes on the related meanings of _I beam_ and _artificial_."
左,left,"By combining the primitive and the kanji of the last two frames and reading the results, we get: _by one's side_ . . . _craft_. Conveniently, the **left** has traditionally been considered the  ""sinister"" _side_ , where dark and occult _crafts_ are cultivated. Note how the second stroke droops over to the **left** and is longer than the first.",
右,right,"When thinking of the key word **right** , in order to avoid confusion with the previous frame, take advantage of the double meaning here, too. Imagine a little _mouth_ hanging down by your _side_  \- like a little voice of conscience - telling you the **right** thing to do. Here the second stroke should reach out to the **right** and be drawn slightly longer than the first.",
有,possess,"The picture here is of someone with a slab of _meat_ dangling _by the side_ , perhaps from a belt or rope tied around the waist. Think of it as an evil spirit in **possession** of one's soul, who can be exorcized only by allowing fresh _meat_ to hang _by one's side_ until it begins to putrefy and stink so bad that the demon departs. Take careful note of the stroke order.",
賄,bribe,"To the left we have the primitive for a _shellfish_ , and to the right the kanji we just learned for _possess_. Keep the connotation of the last frame for the word _possess_ , and now expand your image of _shells_ to include the ancient value they had as money (a usage that will come in very helpful later on). Now one who is _possessed_ by _shells_ is likely to abandon any higher principles to acquire more and more wealth. These are the easiest ones to **bribe** with a few extra _shells_.",
貢,tribute,A **tribute** has a kind of double-meaning in English: honor paid freely and _money_ collected by coercion. Simply because a ruler bestows a noble name on a deed is hardly any consolation to the masses who must part with their hard- earned _money_. Little wonder that this ancient _craft_ of getting _money_ by calling it a **tribute** has given way to a name closer to how it feels to those who pay it: a tax.,
項,paragraph,"To the right we see a _head_ and to the left an element that means _craft_. When we think of a **paragraph** , we immediately think of a _heading_ device to break a text into parts. (Think of the elaborate _heads_ often seen at the start of medieval manuscripts and the task becomes easier still.) Just where and how to do it belongs to the writer's _craft_. Hence, we define **paragraphing** as the  "" _heading craft_ "" to remember this character.",
刀,sword,"Although this character no longer looks very much like a **sword** , it does have some resemblance to the handle of the **sword**. This is to our advantage, in that it helps us keep make a distinction between two primitive elements based on this kanji.","* In the form of the kanji, this primitive means a _dagger_. When it appears to the right of another element, it is commonly stretched out and takes the sense of a great and flashing _saber_ , a meaning it gets from a character we shall learn later (Frame 1801)."
刃,blade,"Think of using a _dagger_ as a razor **blade** , and it shouldn't be hard to imagine cutting yourself. See the little _drop of_ blood clinging to the **blade**?",
切,cut,"To the right we see the _dagger_ and next to it the number _seven_ whose primitive meaning we decided would be _diced_ (Frame 7). It is hard to think of **cutting** anything with a knife without imagining one of those skillful Japanese chefs. Only let us say that he has had too much to drink at a party, grabs a _dagger_ lying on the mantelpiece and starts _dicing_ up everything insight, starting with the hors d'oeuvres and going on to the furniture and the carpets....",
召,seduce,"A _sword_ or _dagger_ posed over a _mouth_ is how the character for ""beckoning"" is written. The related but less tame key word **seduce** was chosen because it seemed to fit better with the - how shall we put it? - Freudian implications of the kanji. (Observe if you will that it is not sure whether the long slender object is **seducing** the small round one or vice versa.)",* The primitive meaning remains the same: _seduce_. Just be sure to associate it with a very concrete image.
昭,shining,"Let the key word suggest **shining** one's shoes, the purpose of which is to _seduce_ the _sun_ down on them for all to see.",
則,rule,"The character depicts a _clam_ alongside a great and flashing _saber_. Think of digging for _clams_ in an area where there are gaming **rules** governing how large a find has to be before you can keep it. So you take your trusty _saber_ , which you have carefully notched like a yardstick, crack open a _clam_ and then measure the poor little beastie to see if it is as long as the **rules** say it has to be.",
副,vice-,"The key word **vice** has the sense of someone second-in-command. The great and flashing _saber_ to the right (its usual location, so you need not worry about where to put it from now on) and the _wealth_ on the left combine to create an image of dividing one's property to give a share to one's **vice** - _wealth_ holder.",
別,separate,"In the Old East, the samurai and his _saber_ were never **separated**. They were constant companions, like the cowboy of the Old West and his six-shooter. This character depicts what must have been the height of **separation** -anxiety for a samurai: to be _bound up with a rope_ and unable to get at his _saber_ leaning only a few feet away from him. Look at that _mouth_ bellowing out for shame and sorrow! Note the order in which the element for _tied up_ is written - just as it had been with the character for _ten thousand_.",
丁,street,"The picture here is of a **street** sign on a long pole: Hollywood and Vine, if you please, or any _street_ that immediately conjure sup the image of a **street** sign to you.","* Used as a primitive, we change the meaning of the key word and take the shape to signify a _nail_ or a _spike_. Should it happen, on reviewing, that you find the pictographs get jumbled, then think of jerking a _street_ sign out of the ground and using it as a _nail_ to repair your garage roof."
町,village,"_Street_ signs standing at the corner of the _rice fields_ depict the **village** limits. (Remember what was said earlier: when used as a primitive, a kanji may either take its primitive meaning or revert to the original meaning of its key word.)",
可,can,"Remember the story about the ""Little Engine that **Could** "" when you hear this key word, and the rest is simple. See the determined little locomotive huffing and puffing up the mountain - ""I think I **can** , I think I **can**.... "" \- spitting railroad _spikes_ out of its _mouth_ as it chews up the line to the top.",
頂,place on the head,"The key word is actually a formal metaphor meaning ""humble acceptance."" Reading off the two primitive elements in the order of their writing, we have: _nail_ . . . _head_. As in  ""hitting the _nail_ on the _head_. "" Now one presumes that most people can handle metaphors, but if you were to run into a dimwit working in a hardware store who only knew the literal meaning of things, and were to ask him, in your best Japanese, to **place on your head** a nail, he might miss the point and cause you considerable torment.",
子,child,"This kanji is a pictograph of a **child** wrapped up in one of those handy cocoons that Japanese mothers fix to their backs to carry around young **children** who cannot get around by themselves. The first stroke is like a wee head popping out for air, the second shows the body and legs all wrapped up, and the final stroke shows the arms sticking out to cling to the mother's neck.","* As a primitive, the meaning of _child_ is retained, though you might imagine a little older _child_ , able to run around and get into more mischief."
孔,cavity,"Probably the one thing most _children_ fear more than anything else is the dentist's chair. Once a _child_ has seen a dentist holding the x-rays up to the light and heard that ominous word **cavity** , even though it is not likely to know that the word means ""hole"" until it is much older, it will not be long before those two syllables get associated with the drill and that row of shiny _hooks_ the dentist uses to torture people who are too small to fight back.",
了,complete,"Learn this character by returning to frame 99 and the image given there. The only difference is that the ""arms"" have been left off (actually, only tucked inside). Thus a _child_ with its arms wrapped up into the back-sack is the picture of a job successfully **completed**.",
女,woman,"You have probably seen somewhere the form of a squatting **woman** drawn behind this character, with two legs at the bottom, two arms (the horizontal line) and the head poking out the top. A little farfetched, until you draw the character and feel the grace and flow of the three simple strokes. Remembering the kanji is easy, being able to write it beautifully is another thing.",* The primitive meaning is the same: _woman_.
好,fond,"The phrase ""to be **fond** of someone "" has a natural gentleness about it, and lends a tenderness to the sense of touching by giving us the related term ""to **fondle**. "" The character likens it to a _woman_ **fondling** her _child_.",
如,likeness,"Pardon me if I revert to the venerable old Dr. Freud again, but his eye for symbolism is often helpful to appreciate things that more earthy imaginations once accepted more freely but that we have learned to cover over with a veneer of etiquette. For instance, the fact that things like the _mouth_ of a cave served as natural ritual substitutes for the opening through which a _woman_ gives birth. Hence, in order to be reborn as an adult, one may have to pass through the psychological equivalent of the womb, that is, something that bears a **likeness** to the _opening_ of the _woman_ from whom you were born.",
母,mama,"Look closely at this kanji and you will find the outline of the kanji for _woman_ in it, the second stroke of which has been expanded to make space for the two breasts that make her a **mama**. Likening this sound to a baby nursing at its mother's breast has afforded some scholars of comparative linguistics a way to explain the presence of the same word across a wide range of language groups.","* As a primitive we shall add the meaning of _breasts_ in accord with the explanation given above. Take careful note of the fact that the form is altered slightly when this kanji serves as a primitive, the final two dots joining together to form a longer stroke. An example follows in the next frame."
貫,pierce,"If one is asked to think of associations for the word **pierce** , among the first to come to mind is that of **piercing** one's ears to hold earrings, a quite primitive form of self-mutilation that has survived into the 21st century. The kanji here is read, top to bottom: _mama_ . . . _oyster_. All you need to do is imagine **piercing** an ear so that it can hold a mother-of- pearl (actually, a _mama_ -of-pearl) you have just wrested from an _oyster_.",
兄,elder brother,"By now kanji like this one should ""look like"" something to you even though it is more of an ""ideogram"" than a ""pictograph."" The large _mouth_ on top and the _human legs_ below almost jump off the page as a caricature of **elder brother** , the one with the big _mouth_ (or if you prefer a kinder image, the one who  ""has the say"" among all the children).","* As a primitive this character will take the meaning of _teenager_ , in accord with the familiar image of the big _mouth_ and the gangling, clumsy _legs_."
呪,curse,"For some reason, the inventor of this kanji associated a **curse** with the _mouth_ of an _older brother_. I leave it to you to decide if he is on the giving or receiving end of the sorcery.",
克,overcome,"In this frame we get a chance to use the kanji we just learned in its primitive meaning of _teenager_. The _needle_ on top indicates one of the major problems confronting the _teenager_ growing up in today's world: drugs. Many of them will fall under the shadow of the _needle_ at some time during those tender years, but only when a whole generation rises up and decides that ""We Shall **Overcome** "" the plague, will the _needle_ cease to hangover their heads, as it does in this character.",
小,little,"The sense of **little** that this character represents is not the same as  ""a little bit."" That meaning comes in the next frame. Here **little** means ""small"" or ""tiny."" The image is one of three **little** _drops_ , the first of which (the one in the middle) is written larger so that the kanji has some shape to it. The point of writing it three times is to rub the point in: **little** , **little** , nothing but **little**.","* The primitive of the same shape keeps the same meaning. Written above a horizontal line, its form is slightly altered, the last two strokes turning inwards."
少,few,"First we need to look at the fourth stroke, the _drop_ at the bottom that has been extended into a longer diagonal stroke leaning left. This happens because a single, isolated drop will NEVER appear beneath its relative primitive in its normal size, for fear it would drop off and get lost. As for the meaning, let the tiny _drop_ indicate a further belittling of what is already _little_ \- thus making it a **few** of something _little_.",
大,large,"Here we have a simple pictograph of a person, taking up the space of an entire character and giving it the sense of **large**. It should not be too hard to locate the two legs and outstretched arms.","* As a primitive, we need a different meaning, since the element representing the human person will come up later. Therefore, this shape will become a _large dog_ or, if you prefer, a _St. Bernard dog_. In frame 253 we will explain why this choice was made."
多,many," **Many** _moons_ ago,  begins much of Amerindian folklore - a colorful way of saying ""Once upon a time"" and a great deal of help for remembering this kanji. Here we have two _moons_  (three of them would take us back to the beginning of time, which is further than we want to go), lacking the final stroke because they are partially hidden behind the clouds of time.",
夕,evening,"Just as the word **evening** adds a touch of formality or romanticism to the ordinary word  ""night,"" so the kanji for **evening** takes the ordinary looking _moon_ in the night sky and has a cloud pass over it (as we saw in the last frame).",* The primitive keeps the same meaning and connotation as the kanji.
汐,eventide,"In the next lesson we will meet the character for morning- _tide_ and the element for _drops of water_. Meantime we have a perfect blend of picture and idea in this kanji to play on the English word for nightfall, **eventide** : _drops of water_ inching their way up the shore in the _evening_.",
外,outside,"On the left, the primitive for _evening_ , and on the right, that for the _magic wand_. Now, as every magician worth his abracadabra knows, bringing your _magic wand_ out into the _evening_ air makes your magic much more powerful than if you were to stay indoors. Hence, _evening_ and _magic wand_ takes you naturally **outside**.",
名,name,"Perhaps you have heard of the custom, still preserved in certain African tribes, of a father creeping into the tent or hut of his newborn child on the night of the child's birth, to whisper into its ear the **name** he has chosen for it, before making his choice public. It is an impressive **naming** custom and fits in tidily with the way this character is constructed: _evening_ . . . _mouth_. At _evening_ time, a _mouth_ pronounces the **name** that will accompany one throughout life.",
石,stone,"With a _mouth_ under a _cliff_ , what else could we have here but the entrance to a secret cavern, before which a great **stone** has been rolled so that none may enter. Perhaps it is the hiding place where Ali Baba and his band of thieves have stored their treasures, in which case that magic word known to every school child who ever delighted over the tales of the _Arabian Nights_ should be enough to push the **stone** aside. But take care - the _cliff_ is steep, and one slip will send you tumbling down into the ravine below. This is the one and only time that the second stroke in _cliff_ will reach over to the middle of the horizontal stroke. If you think of the edge jutting outwards (in keeping with the story above), the problem should be taken care of.","* The _stone_ is a quite common primitive element, which is not restricted to great boulders but used of _stones_ or _rocks_ of any size or shape."
肖,resemblance,"The word **resemblance** should suggest, among other things, a son's **resemblance** to his father. A  ""chip off the old block"" is the way we often put it, but the character is more simple. It speaks of a _little_ bit of _flesh_.","* When used as a primitive, the sense of _resemblance_ is replaced by that of _spark_ or _candle_. (If you want an explanation: the kanji for _moon_ also carries a secondary sense of _fire_ , which we omitted because we are keeping that meaning for other primitives.)"
硝,nitrate,"The word **nitrate** should immediately suggest a beaker of **nitric** acid, which, as every high-school chemistry student knows, can eat its way through some pretty tough substances. Here we imagine pouring it over a _rock_ and watching the _sparks_ fly as it bores a hole through the rock.",
砕,smash,"We begin with the two elements on the right, _baseball_ and _needle_. Since they will be coming together from time to time, let us give the two of them the sense of a _game of cricket_ in which a _needle_ is laid across the wicket. Then imagine using a _rock_ for a ball. A **smash** hit would probably splinter the bat in all directions, and a **smashing** pitch would do the same with the _needle_ wicket.",
砂,sand,Good **sand** for beaches has _few_ or no _stones_ in it. That means that all of us whose feet have been spoiled by too much time in shoes don't have to watch our step as we cavort about.,
妬,jealous,It should not be hard to leep from the key word to the image of a _woman_ who is **jealous** of the _rock_ that another _woman_ is sporting on the third finger of her left hand.,
削,plane,"Long before the invention of the carpenter's **plane** , people used knives and machetes (or here, _sabers_ ) to smooth out their woodwork. If you have ever seen the process, you will have been amazed at the speed and agility with which the adept can **plane** a hunk of wood into shape. Indeed, you can almost see the _sparks_ fly from their _sabers_.",
光,ray,"There are really only 2 primitives here, _little_ and _human legs_. The 4th stroke that separates them is added for reasons of aesthetics. (If that doesn't make sense, try writing the kanji without it and see how ugly the results look, even to your beginner's eye.) Now if you have wondered what those little particles of  ""dust"" are that dance around in the light- **rays** that come through the window and fall on your desk, try imagining them as _little_ and disembodied _human legs_ , and you should have no trouble with this character.",
太,plump, **Plump**  is one of those delightful English words that almost sound like their meaning. No sooner do you hear it than you think of a round and ample- bodied person falling into a sofa like a _large drop_ of oil plopping into a fishbowl - kerrrr- **plump**!,
器,utensil,"The picture in this kanji is not a pleasant one. It shows a large and fluffy _St. Bernard dog_ stretched out on a table all stuffed and stewed and garnished with vegetables, its paws in the air and an apple in its mouth. At each corner of the table sits an eager but empty _mouth_ , waiting for the **utensils** to arrive so the feast can begin.",
臭,stinking,"This character is a bit friendlier to the animal world. Our friend the _St. Bernard_ is alive and well, its _nose_ in the air sniffing suspiciously after something **stinking** somewhere or other.",
嗅,sniff,You have seen those scratch'n' **sniff** advertisements for perfumes. This one is for a _mouth_ wash that replaces one _stinking_ oder with another.,
妙,exquisite,"The primitive for _woman_ is on the left (there and at the bottom of another primitive is where you will always find her), and to the right the element for _few_. When we refer to a _woman_ as **exquisite** , we mean to praise her as the sort of person we meet but _few_ and far between. If you are interested in etymologies, it might help to recall that the Latin phrase lying at the root of the English word **exquisite** carries this same sense of  ""seeking out"" the rare from the ordinary.",
省,focus,"When we think of **focusing** on something, we usually take it in a metaphorical sense, though the literal sense is not far behind. It means to block out what is nonessential in order to fix our _eye_ on a _few_ important matters. The kanji suggests picking up a _few_ things and holding them before one's _eye_ in order to **focus** on them better.",
厚,thick,"When we refer to someone as **thick** -skinned or **thick-** headed, we are usually quick to add - even if only under our breath - something about their upbringing. Perhaps it is because deep down we cherish the belief that by nature people are basically tender and sensitive. Be that as it may, the Japanese character for **thick** depicts a _child_ abandoned out on the wild _cliffs_ , exposed to the heat of the _sun_ , and thus doomed to develop a head and skin as **thick** as the parent who left it there.",
奇,strange,"The elements we are given to work with here are _St. Bernard dog_ and _can_. Lots of phrases pop to mind to attach these words to the key word, but they end up too abstract because of the word _can_. It is important in such cases (and there will be plenty of them as we go along)  to stick closely to the elements, in this case, _mouth_  and _nails_. Now all we need do is create a fictitious  "" **Strange** But True "" column in the Sunday funnies, featuring a _St. Bernard_ whose _mouth_ has been _nailed_ shut because he was hitting the brandy keg around his neck too hard.",
川,stream,"We have taken the image of a river **stream** over into English to describe things that fall down in straight lines, or ripple along in lines. All of this is more than evident in the kanji given here, a pictograph of a **stream**.","* As a primitive, this character adds to the meaning of _stream_ the more vivid image of a _flood_. Note, however, that there are certain small changes in the writing of the element, depending on where it appears relative to other elements: on the left, it is written the same. on the top, it is written with the three strokes more like less-then signs on the bottom, it is written with the third stroke similar to a fishhook"
州,state,"Here we see _drops of_ land (little islets) rising up out of a _stream_ , creating a kind of sandbar or breakwater. Ever wonder how the **state** -line is drawn between **states** separated by a river? If there were little _drops of_ land as in the kanji, there'd be nothing to it.",
順,obey,"In primitive language, this character would read _stream_ . . . _head_. And that turns out to be convenient for remembering its meaning of **obey**. Either one **obeys** the person who is _head_ of an organization or else **obeys** by following the _stream_ of opinion ( ""current"" practice, we call it). Both these senses come together in this kanji.",
水,water,"This character, which looks a bit like a snowflake, is actually a pictograph of **water**  \- not any particular body of water or movement of water, but simply the generic name for **water**. Should you have any difficulty remembering it, simply think of a _walking stick_ being dropped vertically into the **water** , sending _droplets_ out in all four directions. Then all you need to learn is how to write it in proper order.","* As a primitive, this character can keep its form, or it can be written with three drops to the left of another primitive. This latter, as we will see, is far more common."
氷,icicle,"The appearance of the primitive for _water_ in its full form tells us that we have something to do with _water_ here. The extra _drop_ to the left, added as a second stroke, changes the picture from a splash caused by a _walking stick_ dropped into _water_ to form an **icicle**. If it helps, when you hold an **icicle** up to the light, you can usually see little crystallizations of five-pointed stars inside of it, which is the shape we have in this kanji.",
永,eternity,"This kanji also uses the full form of _water_ , though its meaning seems to have nothing at all to do with _water_. Remember what William Blake said about seeing  ""infinity in a grain of sand and **eternity** in an hour ""? Well, reading this character from top to bottom, we see "" **eternity** in a _drop of water_. """,
泉,spring,"Call to mind the image of a fresh, bubbling **spring** of _water_ , and you will probably notice how the top of the **spring** you are thinking of, the part where the  ""bubbling"" goes on, is all _white_. Happily, the _white_ is just where it should be, at the top, and the _water_ is at the bottom.","* We will keep this image of a _spring_ when using this kanji as a primitive, but not without first drawing attention to a slight change that distinguishes the primitive from the kanji. The final 4 strokes (the element for _water_ ) are abbreviated to the three small drops that we learned earlier as the kanji for _little_."
腺,gland,Dig into your _flesh_ and pull out a lymph **gland**. Now give it a squeeze and watch the _spring_ of lymph spout out of it.,
原,meadow,"Though the kanji is broad enough to embrace both meanings, the **meadow** you should imagine here is not a flatland plain but a mountain **meadow** in the Austrian Alps. (Perhaps the opening scene of  ""The Sound of Music"" will help.) Simply think of little _springs_ bubbling up across the **meadow** to form a sort of path that leads you right to the brink of a precipitous _cliff_. Now if you can see Schwester Maria skipping along merrily, dodging in and out of the _springs_ , and then falling headlong over the _cliff_ , you have a ridiculous story that should help fix this kanji in memory.",
願,petition,"A _meadow_ and a _head_ are all we are given to work with in the kanji for **petition**. Since the key word already suggests something like a formal request made of some higher power, let us imagine a gigantic Wizard-of-Oz _head_ located in the middle of the flowery _meadow_ we used in the last frame. Then just picture people kneeling hopefully before it, **petitioning** for whatever it is they want. (The scarecrow wanted brains, the lion, courage, and the tin man a heart. What about you?)",
泳,swim,"The primitive to the left, you will recall from Frame 137, represents _water_. To the right, we see the kanji for _eternity_. Knowing how much children like **swimming** , what could be a better image of _eternal_ bliss than an endless expanse of _water_ to **swim** in without a care in the world?",
沼,marsh,"Unlike the meadow with its cliffs, the **marsh** lands are low and near a source of _water_ that feeds them until they get soggy through and through. Why certain land becomes **marshy** is probably due to the fact that it felt thirsty, and so tried its best to _seduce_ the _water_ over to its side. But, like most inordinate _seductions_ , the last state of the victim is worse than the first. Hence the slushy **marsh**.",
沖,open sea,"This kanji could hardly be simpler. The key word **open sea** readily suggests being out _in the middle of_ a great body of _water_ .Thinking of it in this way should avoid confusion with the kanji for  ""open,"" which we will meet later on.",
汎,pan-,"The sense of the key word here is the ""all-inclusive"" we find in terms like "" **Pan-** American Games."" (It is also the character used in mathematics for ""partial"" as in partial differentials, in case you are a math major and want to take your story in that direction.) Instead of a _water_ sports event that brings together the best talent, think of a meet of the region's most _mediocre_ athletes, many of whom cannot even tread _water_. Now try to find a sponsor for the  "" **Pan-** _Mediocre_ _Water_ Sports Competition. """,
江,creek,"Unlike the river, the ocean, the lake, and the pond, the **creek** is often no more then a dribble of _water_ trickling down a small gully. While the geological history of the larger bodies of _water_ is hard to surmise sometimes, all of us know from our childhood how **creeks** are made. You probably even dug one or two in your time. All you need to do is find a mainstream of _water_ somewhere and dig a little path into dry land. The **creek** is thus a lesson in _water-craft_ , as this kanji would agree.",
汰,cleanse,"This character can mean both to **cleanse** and to make dirty. We will choose the latter and imagine someone who is displeasingly _plump_ going to a skinny spa whose medicinal _waters_ promise to **cleanse** him of his unwanted corpulence. Picture him sitting in the spa as the pounds melt away, leaving a greasy scum on top of the _water_.",
汁,soup,"To make **soup** , one begins with _water_ and then starts adding things to it, often leftovers from the icebox. This is how the thick **soup** or stew called  ""seven-in-one"" is made. This kanji does it three better, giving us a _ten_ -ingredient **soup**.",
沙,grains of sand,"We have already learned the kanji for _sand_ (Frame 122), so let's use it to remember the character for **grains of sand**. Instead of the  ""few stones"" that make for nice sand, here we have a _few drops of water_ , one for each **grand of sand** \- a beach in perfect ecological balance.",
潮,tide,"Before we get to explaining this character, take a look at it and see if you can figure out the primitive elements on your own.... On the left is the _water_  \- that much is easy. On the right we have only one primitive, the kanji for _morning_ learned back in Frame 53. See how an apparently complex kanji falls apart neatly into manageable pieces? To get the meaning of the key word **tide** , just think of it in connection with the character for _eventide_ that we learned back in Frame 115. Here we have the _morning_ - **tide** , its complement. By the way, if you missed the question about the number of primitives, it is probably because you forgot what we said earlier about kanji becoming primitives, independently of the pieces that make them up. As a rule, look for the largest kanji you can write and proceed from there to primitives stranded on their own.",
源,source,"With the advice of the last frame in mind, it is easy to see _water_ and _meadow_ in this character for **source**. Both in its etymology (it has a common parent with the word  ""surge"") and in popular usage, **source** suggests the place _water_ comes from. In this kanji, it is under the _meadow_ , where we just saw it breaking the surface in those bubbly little _springs_.",
活,lively,"When we speak of a **lively** personality or a **lively** party, we immediately think of a lot of chatter. This kanji depicts the idea of **lively** by having _tongues_ babble and splash around like flowing _water_.",
消,extinguish,"Among the many things _water_ is useful for is **extinguishing** fires, and that is just what we have here. First of all, take the _water_ at the left as the _drops of water_ that are used to depict _water_ in general. In the best of all possible worlds, the most efficient way to **extinguish** a fire would be to see that each _drop of water_ hits one _spark_ of the conflagration. An unthinkable bit of utopian fire fighting, you say to yourself, but helpful for assigning this key word its primitives.",
況,but of course,"This key word is a connector used to link contrasting phrase sand sentences together with much the same flavor as the English phrase **but of course**. Just picture yourself ready to go off on your first date as a _teenager_ , and having your mother grill you about your manners and ask you embarrassing questions about your hygiene. ""Did you have a good shower?"" "" **But of course** ,"" you reply, annoyed. So _water_ and _teenager_ combine to give us **but of course**.",
河,river,"The character in this frame represents a step up from the _stream_ we met in Frame 134, it is a full-sized **river**. The _water_ to the left tells us what we are dealing with, and the _can_ at the right tells us that our  ""little engine that _could_ "" has now become amphibious and is chugging down the Mighty Mississip' like a regular riverboat.",
泊,overnight,"When you stop at an inn for an **overnight** rest, all you expect is a bit of _water_ for a wash and a set of clean _white_ sheets to wrap your weary bones in.",
湖,lake,"_Water_ . . . _old_ . . . _flesh_. You have heard of legends of people being abandoned in the mountains when they had become too old to work. Well, here is a legend about people being set adrift in the _waters_ of a stormy **lake** because their _flesh_ had gotten too _old_ to bear the burdens of life.",
測,fathom,"Connoting the measurement of the depth of _water_ , the keyword **fathom** begins with the _water_ primitive. To its right, we see the compound-primitive for _rule_ (Frame 92) which we learned in the sense of a  ""ruler"" or ""measure."" Hence, when we _rule_ _water_ we **fathom** it. What could be simpler? But be careful, its simplicity is deceptive. Be sure to picture yourself **fathoming** a body of _water_ several hundred feet deep by using a _ruler_ of gargantuan proportions.",
土,soil,"I don't like it any more than you do, but this kanji is not the pictograph it is trumped up to be: a mound of **soil** piled on the ground. All I can recommend is that you memorize it as it is. Anyway, it will be occurring with such frequency that you have almost no chance of forgetting it, even if you try.","* As a primitive, the sense of _soil_ is extended to that of _ground_ because of its connection with the kanji for the same (Frame 554). From there it also takes the added meanings of _dirt_ and _land_."
吐,spit,We have here a rather small _mouth_ (it is always compressed when set on the left) next to a much larger piece of _dirt_. It is not hard to imagine what you might do if you got a _mouth_ full of _dirt_. As least I know what I would do: **spit** it out as fast and far as I could!,
圧,pressure,"One of the things that causes the erosion of _soil_ is the excessive **pressure** of the top _soil_ on the lower _soil_. This can be caused by any number of things from heavy rainfall to heavy buildings to the absence of sufficient deep-rooted vegetation to hold the layers together. Here we see a steep _cliff_ without a tree in sight. The **slightest** pressure on it will cause a landslide, which, with a little help from your imagination, you will be able to see happening in this character.",
埼,cape,"The **cape** pictured here is a jut of _land_ like **Cape** Cod. The _soil_ on the left tells us we have to do with _land_ , and the _strange_ on the right tells us it is a **_cape_** where unusual things go on. Put a haunted house on it, an eerie sky overhead, and a howling wind rustling through the trees, and you have yourself a picture of **Cape** _Strange_ (or, if you prefer, **Cape** _Odd_ ).",
垣,hedge,"The **hedge** depicted in this frame is the miraculous **hedge** of briar roses that completely _spanned_ the castle _grounds_ in which Sleeping Beauty lay for a hundred years, so that none but her predestined beloved could find his way through it.",
填,inlay,"When we hear the world **inlay** , we usually think of setting precious stones in pieces of jewelery, but the primitive elements here suggest _truth_ being **inlaid** in the _soil_. You might think instead of the cosmic wisdom that **inlaid** the _truth_ of the universe in the stuff of the earth.",
圭,squared jewel,"Now I am going to do something unusual. The character in this frame is going to get one meaning and the primitive another, with no relation at all between the two. In time, I hope you will see how helpful this is. The kanji key word, **square jewel** , depicts a mammoth precious stone, several feet high, made by piling up large heaps of _soil_ on top of one another. Not something you would want to present your betrothed on your wedding day, but a good image for remembering this rare character, used chiefly in personal names nowadays.","* As a primitive, we shall use this character to mean _ivy_ , that creepy vegetation that covers the surface of the _ground_ to form a sort of  ""second"" _ground_ that can get somewhat tricky to walk on without tripping."
封,seal,"Think of the key word **seal** as referring to a letter you have written and are preparing to close. Instead of using the traditional wax **seal** , you _glue_ a sprig of _ivy_ on the outside. In this way the elements _ivy_ and _glue_ give you a curious and memorable way to **seal** your secret letters.",
涯,horizon,"After seeing a constant **horizon** of _water_ , _water_ everywhere for months at sea, could there be anything more delightful to the eyes than to look astern and see the _ivy_ -clad _cliffs_ of land on a new **horizon**? Of course, you'd need the eyes of a stellar telescope to recognize that the vegetation was in fact _ivy_ , but the phrase "" _ivy_ -clad _cliffs_ "" has such a nice ring to it that we won't worry about such details.",
寺,Buddhist temple,"You have heard of people ""attaching"" themselves to a particular sect? Here is your chance to take that metaphor literally and imagine some fellow walking into a **Buddhist temple** with a fervent resolve to attach himself to the place. Since there is plenty of unused _land_ around the precincts, he simply picks out a suitable patch, brushes the soles of his feet with _glue_ , steps down firmly, and so joins the **Buddhist temple** as a  ""permanent member.""",
時,time,"What is **time**?  asked St. Augustine in his memoirs. ""Ask me not, and I know. Ask me, and I cannot tell you."" Here we have the kanji's answer to that perennial riddle. **Time** is a _sun_ rising over a _Buddhist temple_. It sounds almost like a Zen kōan whose repetition might yield some deep secret to the initiated. At any rate, imagining a monk seated in meditation pondering it might help us remember the character.",
均,level,"The **level** this key word refers to is not the carpenter's tool but rather the even surface of a thing. It pictures _soil_ being scooped up into a _ladle_ and then made **level** (apparently because one is measuring _soil_ ). The excess _drops of soil_ are brushed off the top, which accounts for the added _drop_ at the _ladle's_ edge.",
火,fire,"Just as sitting before a **fire** enlivens the imagination and lets you see almost anything you want to in the flames, this kanji is so simple it lets you see almost any sort of **fire** you want to see. It no longer makes a good pictograph, but I invite you to take a pencil and paper and play with the form - first writing it as shown below and then adding lines here and there - to see what you can come up with. Everything from matchbooks to cigarette lighters to volcanic eruptions to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah have been found here. No doubt you, too, will find something interesting to bend your memory around these four simple strokes.","* To avoid confusion later on, it is best to keep to the meaning of a _fireplace_ (or _hearth_ ) or a raging _conflagration_ like a forest fire for this kanji's primitive meaning. Another primitive element for _fire_ , based on this one, is written as 4 small drops and will mean _flames_ , _cauldron_ , _cooking fire_ , or an _oven fire_."
炎,inflammation,"A _fire_ belongs IN the _hearth_ , not OVER it. When the _fire_ spreads to the rest of the house, we have an **inflamed** house. And as with any **inflammation**  \- including those that attack our bodies - the danger is always that it might spread if not checked. This is the sense behind the reduplication of element for _fire_ , one atop the other.",
煩,anxiety,"The existential condition of **anxiety** that arises from the inevitable frustration of our worldly passions is contained in this character. The _head_ is set _afire_ , causing deep torment of spirit (and a whopper of a headache).",
淡,thin,"The primitives in this kanji read: _water_ . . . _inflammation_. Taking _inflammation_ in its medical sense, the first _water_ -related _inflammation_ that pops into mind is dehydration, the principal symptom of which is that it makes one shrivel up and look very, very **thin**. If that is hard to remember, try thinking it backwards: a very **thin** chap passes by and you imagine him suffering from (being _inflamed_ with) dehydration (hence the element for _water_ ).",
灯,lamp,"Since it is very hard to read by the _fireplace_ without going blind from the flickering of the flames or burning up from the heat, our ancestors invented a way to _nail_ down a bit of that _fire_ , just enough to light up the text of their evening newspapers and no more. Voilà! The **lamp**.",
畑,farm,"Looking at the primitives, a _fireplace_ and a _rice field_ , we find the essential ingredients for a **farm** : a warm _hearth_ to sit by at night, and a well-plowed _field_ to grow one's crops in by day.",
災,disaster,"Of all of nature's **disasters** , this kanji picks out two of the worst: _floods_ and _fires_. To recall the disposition of the elements, think of nature's solution to nature's own problem: a great _flood_ pouring down over a great forest _fire_.",
灰,ashes,"The kanji for **ashes** naturally includes the primitive for _fire_ , or more specifically, a _fireplace_. Now what do you do with that bucket of **ashes** you have just cleaned out of the _fireplace_? You walk to the edge of a _cliff_ and tip it upside down, watching as they are swept away in the wind like a swarm of gray mosquitoes. Thus the _fire_ , once it has turned to **ashes** , ends up at the bottom of the _cliff_.",
点,spot,"If you look into the flickering of a _fire_ for a long time and then turn aside, you will see **spots** before your eyes. Although nobody ever thought of such a thing before - as least as far as know, they didn't - imagine using those **spots** as a technique for _fortune-telling_. The old witch sits before her _cauldron_ and watches the **spots** that show up when she turns to look at you, and from that _tells your fortune_. Think of it as a kind of **spot** -check on your future.",
照,illuminate,"Although the range of possible meanings that the kanji for **illuminate** can have is about as rich as the connotations of the English word, we need to focus on just one of them: to make something _shine_. If you glaze a pot and put it into the _oven_ to _fire_ it, you in fact _illuminate_ it. Hence the kanji for **illuminate** compares the kanji for _shining_ with the primitive element for the _oven's fire_.",
魚,fish,"The composition of this kanji shows three elements, which we list in the order of their writing: _bound up_ . . . _rice field_ . . . _cooking fire_. Not much to work with at first sight. But we can join them together by thinking of a three-part story: first a **fish** is caught and _bound up_ on a line with its unfortunate school-mates, when the fisherman gets home, he cuts off the head and tosses it, with the entrails, out into the _rice fields_ for fertilizer, and the rest he sets in a skillet over a _cooking fire_ for his supper.",
漁,fishing,"To the story we have just made about _fish_ , this kanji for the profession of **fishing** adds yet another element BEFORE the others: namely the _water_ , where the fish was happily at home before being caught, disemboweled, and eaten. Be sure to get a clear image of the _water_  when you put it all together.",
里,ri,"That's right - a **_ri_**. Don't bother looking it up in your English dictionary, it's a Japanese word for measuring distances. One **_ri_** is about 4 kilometers or 2.5 miles. The kanji depicts how the measure came to be used. Atop we see the _rice field_ , and below the element for _land_. Those four sections you see in the _rice field_ (and which we made mention of when first we introduced the character in frame 14) are actually measurements of _land_ , much the same as farm-sections in the United States have given us the notion of a ""country mile."" The _land_ division based on the size of a _rice field_ is called a **_ri_**.","* To get a more concrete primitive meaning for this kanji, we shall refer to it as a _computer_ , a meaning deriving from the kanji for _logic_ , which we will meet in Lesson 12."
黒,black,"Like most things electrical, a _computer_ , too, can overheat. Just imagine _flames_ pouring out of it and charring the keyboard, the monitor, and your desk a sooty **black** color.",
墨,black ink,"Besides meaning **black ink** , this kanji also appears in the word for an inked string that is pulled taut and snapped to mark a surface, much the same as one might used a chalked string. Here it is used to mark off the _dirt_ with _black_ lines for a foot ballgame (played, I presume, on a white field).",
鯉,carp,"These are the same **carp** you see in Japanese  "" **carp** streamers. "" Only here we find a small home _computer_ or two strung on the line by a father anxious for his son not only to have the courage and determination of a **carp** swimming upstream, but also the efficiency and memory of a _computer_. Ugh.",
量,quantity,"Think of **quantity** as having to do with measuring time and distance, and the rest is simple: you have a quantity of time in the new day that begins with _nightbreak_ , and a quantity of distance in the rural _ri_.",
厘,rin,"No doubt you will find it in your heart to forgive me for forcing yet another Japanese word on you in this frame. It is not the last time it will happen in this book, but I can assure you they are used only when absolutely necessary. One **_rin_** is equal to about 1/1000 of a yen - or rather was worth that much when it still made economic sense to mint them. While inflation took its toll on this kanji as a monetary unit, it survived with the not at all surprising sense of something  ""very, very tiny."" The kanji shows a _cliff_ with a _computer_ under it, apparently because it has been pushed over into the abyss by someone fed up with the thing. The total market value of one home _computer_ that has fallen over rock and bramble for several hundred feet: about one **_rin_**!",
埋,bury,"When we speak of **burying** something (or someone, for that matter), we usually mean putting them under _ground_. Only here, we are **burying** our beloved _computer_ that has served us so well these past years. Behind us a choir chants the  ""Dies irae, dies illa"" and there is much wailing and grief among the bystanders as they pass by to shovel a little _dirt_ into what will be its final resting place. R.I.P.",
同,same,"The primitives in this kanji show us _one_ and _mouth_ under a _hood_. Let us take the key word to connote the **sameness** that characterizes the life in community of the monk. They all have the **same** habits, including the ""habit"" they wear on their backs. Here we see the monk's _cowl_ , drawn down over the eyes so that all you can see when you look at him is a _mouth_. But since monks also speak their prayers in common, it is but a short step to think of _one mouth_ under a _hood_ as the kanji for the **sameness** of monastic life.","* As a primitive, this will mean _monks_ dressed in a common habit."
洞,den,"The key word **den** refers to an animal lair hollowed out in the side of a mountain. Now if we keep to the image of the monastic life as an image for _same_ , we can picture a **den** of wild beasts dressed up in habits and living the common life in a mountain cavern. To bring in the element of _water_ we need only give them a sacred  ""puddle"" in the center of their **den** , the focus of all their pious attentions.",
胴,trunk,"The word **trunk** refers to the _part of the body_ that is left when you have "" **truncated** "" all the limbs. I can hardly think of any reason for doing so, unless one were lumberjacking corpses and needed to have them all properly pruned and made the _same_ so they could be floated downstream without causing a _body_ -jam.",
向,yonder,"Something referred to as ""over **yonder** "" is usually far off in the distance and barely within sight - like a wee _drop_ in the distance - and is usually an expression used in giving directions or pointing something out. Hence this kanji begins with a _drop_. Then we find a sort of transparent _helmet_ with no eyes or nose, but only a prominent _mouth_ under it, obviously an extraterrestrial. And what is it jabbering on about with its _mouth_ open like that? Why, about his spaceship way over **yonder** with its fuel tank on empty.",
尚,esteem,"Above we see the primitive for _little_ attached to one of those _glass canopies_ you might use to display a family heirloom. The _littleness_ is important, because what is in fact on display is the shrunken, stuffed, and mounted _mouth_ of an **esteemed** ancestor. We may be used to **esteeming** the words our forebears leave behind, but here we also **esteem** the very _mouth_ that spoke them. I leave it to you to imagine a suitable place in your room for displaying such an unusual conversation piece.",
字,character,"Here is the character for **character** itself. Not just kanji, but any written **character** from hieroglyphs to Sanskrit to our own Roman alphabet. It shows us simply a _child_ in a _house_. But let us take advantage of the double-meaning of the key word to note that just as a _child_ born to a Japanese _house_ is given **characters** for its name, so it is also stamped with the **character** of those who raise it from infancy on.",
守,guard,"The notion of **guarding** something easily brings to mind the image of someone standing **guard** , like the royal soldiers in front of Buckingham Palace or the Pope's Swiss **Guard**. The whole idea of hiring **guards** is that they should stick like _glue_ to your _house_ to protect it from unwanted prowlers. So go ahead and _glue_ a **guard** to your _house_ in imagination.",
完,perfect,"In order not to confuse the key word **perfect** with others nearly synonymous in meaning, pull it apart to have a look at its native Latin roots. _Per- factum_ suggests something so  ""thoroughly made or done"" that nothing more needs to be added to it. Now look at the kanji, which does something similar. We see a _house_ that has been made **perfectly** from its _beginnings_ in the foundation to the roof on the top. Now return to frame 101 and make sure not to confuse this key word with the kanji for _complete_.",
宣,proclaim,"Under the primitive for _house_ we meet the kanji for _span_. Think of the key word in its religious sense of missionary preaching:  "" **proclaiming** the good news to all nations "" and ""shouting it from the _housetops_. "" That should be enough to help you remember this simple kanji, used in fact both for traditional missionary work as well as for one of its contemporary replacements: advertising.",
宵,wee hours,"As the key word hints, the kanji in this frame refers to the late evening or early morning hours, well after one should be in bed asleep. It does this by picturing a _house_ with a _candle_ in it. The reason is obvious: whoever is living there is  ""burning the _candle_ at both ends, "" and working night after night into the **wee hours**.",
安,relax,"To be told that the place of the _woman_ is in the _house_ may not sit well with modern thought, but like all cultural habits the Chinese characters bear the birthmarks of their age. So indulge yourself in a Norman Rockwell image of **relaxing** after a hard day's work: the scruffy and weary _woman_ of the _house_ slouched asleep in the living room chair, her hair in curlers and a duster lying in her lap.",
宴,banquet,"To carry on from the last frame, we note the entire _day_ of work that comes between a _woman_ and her _house_ in preparing for a dinner **banquet** , pictorially ""interrupting"" her _relaxation_.",
寄,draw near,"Let the idea of **drawing near** suggest something dangerous or eerie that one approaches with fear and trembling. Here we see a _strange house_ \- perhaps the haunted _House_ of Usher that Edgar Allen Poe immortalized, or the enchanted Gingerbread _House_ that lured Hansel and Gretel to **draw near**.",
富,wealth,"Here we have the original character on which the primitive element for **wealth** is based. In keeping with the story introduced back then, note how all the **wealth** is kept under the roof of the same _house_.",
貯,savings,"To avoid confusing this frame with the last one, try to think of **savings** as actual money. The only difference is that our currency is not paper bills but _shells_ , a not uncommon unit of exchange in older civilizations. The _nail_ under the roof of the _house_ points to a hiding place in the rafters on which one strings up one's _shells_ for safekeeping.",
木,tree,"Here we see a pictograph of a **tree** , showing the main trunk in the long vertical stroke and the boughs in the long horizontal stroke. The final two strokes sweep down in both directions to indicate the roots. Although it may look similar at first sight to the kanji for _water_ (Frame 137), the order in which it is written is completely different and this affects its final appearance.","* As a primitive, this kanji can be used to mean _tree_ or _wood_. In those cases where the last two strokes are detached from the trunk, we shall change its meaning to _pole_ , or _wooden pole_."
林,grove,Learn this frame in connection with the next one. A **grove** is a small cluster of _trees_. Hence the simple reduplication of the kanji for _tree_ gives us the **grove**.,
森,forest,"A **forest** is a large expanse of _trees_ , or "" _trees_ , _trees_ everywhere, "" to adopt the expression we used back in frames 22 and 23.",
桂,Japanese Judas-tree,"Unless you are a botanist, you are not likely to know what a **Japanese Judas- tree** looks like, and probably never even heard of it before, but the name is sufficiently odd to make remembering it easy. Using the primitives as our guide, we define it as a _tree_ with _ivy_ growing down its branches in the shape of a hangman's rope.",
柏,oak,"This kanji calls to mind the famous myth of the ""golden bough."" As you may recall, what made the sacred **oak** in the forest of Diana the Huntress outside of Rome  ""golden"" were the _white_ berries of the mistletoe that grew in the branches of the tree. When the light of the sun shone through them, they turned yellow and the branch to which they clung appeared to be made of gold. (If you don't know the story, take a break today and hunt it down in a dictionary of myth and fable. Even if you forget the kanji - which of course you won't - the story of the mistletoe and the fate it brought to Balder the Beautiful is most memorable.)",
枠,frame,"You might think of the **frame** this character refers to as the sort of **frame** we have created by drawing a dark line around this kanji and its explanation. Then think of that line as made of very thin _wood_ , and finally note how each time the line bends it forms a 90° angle, thus giving us the _nine_ and the _ten_.",
梢,treetops,"As the days grow shorter and shorter, or so the northern European myth goes, the fear grows that the sun will take its leave of us altogether, abandoning the world to total darkness. Fixing _candles_ to the branches of evergreen _trees_ , it was believed, would lure the sun back (like things attracting like things), whence the custom of the lighted tree that eventually found its way into our Christmas customs. The story is a lot longer and more complex than that, but it should help to fix the image of climbing high up into the **treetops** to fix _candles_ on the _tree_.",
棚,shelf,"One often thinks of books as ""good _companions_ ,"" but here it is the **shelf** we store them on that is the _companion_. The reasons should be obvious: it is made of the same stuff, _wood_ , and spends a lot more time with them than we do! Here again, be careful not to let the rationality of the explanation get in the way before you turn it into a proper story.",
杏,apricot,"Since **apricots** can be eaten just as they fall from the _trees_ , picture this _mouth_ agape at the bottom of a _tree_ (just as the elements have it), waiting for **apricots** to fall into it.",
桐,paulownia,"Since you probably don't know what a **paulownia** _tree_ is, we shall let the key word suggest the phrase  ""the Little Brothers of St. **Paulownia.** "" It is a short step to associate the _tree_ with the _monks_ to its right. (For the curious, the name of this oriental _tree_ really comes from a Russian princess, Anna Pavlovna.)",
植,plant,You have no doubt seen how people practicing the Japanese art of bonsai take those helpless little saplings and twist them into crippled dwarves before they have a chance to grow up as they should. The more proper way to **plant** a young _tree_ and give it a fair shake in life is to set it into the earth in such a way that it can grow up _straight_.,
椅,chair,"Instead of making a **chair** out of wood from a _tree_ , this kanji has us making the whole _tree_ into a **chair** , which looks most _strange_ sitting in your living room where the sofa used to be.",
枯,wither,"What makes a _tree_ begin to **wither** up, and perhaps even die, is a kind of arteriosclerosis that keeps its sap from flowing freely. Usually this is due to simple _old age_ , as this character shows us. Be sure to picture a wrinkled _old tree_ , **withering** away in a retirement center so that the commonsense explanation does not take over.",
朴,crude,"As all magicians who have passed their apprenticeship know, one makes one's _wand_ out of a hazel branch and is careful not to alter the natural form of the _wood_. For the magic of the _wand_ derives its power from its association with the hidden laws of nature, and needs therefore to be kept in its **crude** , natural state.",
村,town,"The character for _village_ was associated with _rice fields_ (Frame 96). That for **town** , a step up on the evolutionary path to cities, shows a circle of _trees glued together_ to measure off the confines of a **town**.",
相,inter-,"The prefix **inter-** stirs up associations of cooperation among people. From there we read off the elements: _tree_ . . . _eye_. With only a slight leap of the imagination, those two words call to mind the scriptural proverb about first taking the block of timber out of one's own _eye_ before helping your neighbors with the splinter in theirs. What more useful rule for **inter-** human relationships, and what more useful tool for remembering this kanji!",
机,desk,"We need to fix imagination here on two things to learn the kanji for **desk** : the wonderful rough _wood_ of which it has been hewn and the _wind_ that blows across it, sending your papers flying all over the room. These two elements, written in that order, dictate how to write the character.",
本,book,"Recalling that **books** are made of paper, and paper made of _trees_ , one might think of a **book** as a slice of a _tree_. Can you seethe  ""cross-cut"" in the trunk of the _tree_? Picture it as a chainsaw cutting you out a few **books** with which to start your own private library.",
札,tag,"The **tags** you see hanging on _trees_ in public places in Japan are helpful to identify what sort of _trees_ they are. Next time you see one, imagine the bit of wire that fixes the **tag** to the branch as a large _fishhook_. REALLY imagine it, illogical as it is, and you will never have trouble with this kanji again.",
暦,calendar,"Look at this character in reverse order, from bottom up. First we see the primitive for _days_ , an appropriate enough way to begin a **calendar**. Next we see a _grove of trees_ growing under a _cliff_. The laws of nature being what they are, the _trees_ would be stunted under such conditions, unless they were strong enough to keep growing upwards until they passed through the layers of rock and soil, right up to the surface. Now imagine that in those little boxes marking off the _days_ on your wall **calendar** , you see that very process taking place step by step: 365 or so time-lapse pictures of that _grove of trees_ each month, from January under the _cliff_ to December on top of the _cliff_. The story is not as complex as it sounds, particularly if you happen to have a **calendar** nearby and can flip through it with this image in mind.",
案,plan,"Without much effort, the elements _relax_ . . . _tree_ suggest a hammock strung between two _trees_ in your backyard, and you stretched out in it, hands folded behind your head, **planning** something or other. After all, it's something we all do from time to time: kick up our legs on the nearest piece of furniture and daydream about the best **plan** of action to take. Be sure to relate the _relaxation_ to the _tree_ , so that you don't end up with something else in its place (like ""legs"" or ""desk"" or ""table"").",
燥,parch,"**Parch** ment, made from animal skins, was the most common form of writing material used until the beginning of the nineteenth century. When paper took over, a method was devised to make artificial **parch** ment from _wood_ pulp. The _fire_ at the left and in the  ""strong"" position serves to remind us of the root word, "" **parch** ,"" since nothing dries, puckers, wrinkles, and scorches quite like _fire_. And here is how we put it all together. Take a sheet of paper (a  "" _wood-good_ ,""), wet it, and hold it over a _hearth_ in your mind's eye. Now watch as it **parches** the paper, leaving it with a strange and bumpy surface resembling **parch** ment.",
未,not yet,"As the key word suggests, this kanji has to do with something not quite over and done with. More concretely, it shows us a _tree_ that is **not yet** fully grown. The extra short stroke in the upper branches shows new branches spreading out, leaving one with the feeling that the _tree_ has a ways to go yet before it reaches maturity. In other words, the kanji conveys its meaning pictographically, playing on the earlier pictograph of the _tree_.",
末,extremity,"This character is best learned in connection with that of the previous frame. The first stroke shows a branch that is longer than the main branch, indicating that the tree has reached the **extremity** of its growth, so that its branches stop spreading and start drooping downwards. Be sure to keep this imagery in mind, to avoid confusing this key word with synonyms that will appear later.",
昧,obscure,"The most **obscure** ideas are those that the _sun_ of reason has _not yet_ dawned on. Be sure to give the _sun_ a professorial demeanor, complete with spectacles and a pipe.",
沫,splash,"The **splash** this kanji refers to is the dash of _water_ against the rocks, with all the foam and spray that this creates. If you think of a **splash** in this sense as a wave that has run its full course and reached its _extremity_ , namely the seashore, and if you think of it pictorially in your mind's eye, this somewhat rare (but oh so-easy-to-learn) kanji is yours for good.",
味,flavor,"When a tree has _not yet_ finished growing, it produces fruit with a full **flavor**. When the official taster (the professional _mouth_ to the left) determines that full flavor has been reached, the tree is pruned back so that it remains permanently _not yet_ grown. A neat little agricultural trick and an easy to way see the sense of **flavor** hidden in this character.",
妹,younger sister,"The **younger sister** in the family is the _woman_ in the family who, like the newest branch in a tree, is _not yet_ old enough or mature enough to do everything the elder sister can do (See frame 442).",
朱,vermilion,"That red-orange color we call **vermilion** is found in nature during the fall when the leaves lose their sugar and begin to change color. This kanji depicts the very last leaf on a tree in the fall (the _drop_ hung in the first stroke), the leaf that has _not yet_ fallen as it one day must. Look at its color - vermilion. (Well, not really. The truth is, **vermilion** is made from a mercuric sulfide, but I'm sure you will agree that autumn leaves area lot easier to work with.)",
株,stocks,"The **stocks** bought and sold on the market by the tens of millions each day get their name from a comparison to a healthy _tree_ , in which one takes "" **stock** "" in the hopes that it will grow and produce more and more _trees_ like itself. Usually good **stocks** are referred to as  ""blue chip,"" but here we are asked to associate the key word with the color _vermilion_ , perhaps because one can assess the value of a tree from the color of its autumn leaves.",
若,young,"Here we see a _flower_ held in the _right_ hand. You can imagine yourself in a magic garden where _flowers_ picked with the _right_ hand grant eternal **youth** , and those picked with the left, premature senility. Go ahead, pick one with each hand and watch what happens.",
草,grass,"Perhaps you know the custom of seeding **grass** randomly or in some particular pattern with the _flower_ called the crocus, which blooms for a few days each year in _early_ spring. As the **grass** begins to turn green again after winter has passed, these tiny _flowers_ dot up here and there. Now just look out your window at a patch of **grass** somewhere and think what a nice idea it would be to have your name spelled out in _flowers_ once as a sort of _early_ harbinger of spring.",
苦,suffering,"The picture of **suffering** we are given here is that of a _flower_ that has grown _old_. When a _flower_ ages, it pales and dries up, and probably even **suffers**. If you think that plants are incapable of such feelings, then ask yourself why so many people believe that talking to their flowers helps them bloom better.",
苛,bullying,"A nosegay of _flowers_ make a nice gift, but if those flowers are poison oak, they _can_ amount to **bullying**. Be sure to emphasize the word _can_ when you repeat this little phrase to yourself.",
寛,tolerant,"The _house_ of _flowers_ or  ""hothouse"" has become a metaphor for a narrow- minded, biased, and intolerant attitude distrustful of change. **Tolerance** , in contrast, is open-minded and welcomes novelty. The way to encourage **tolerance** in those who lack it is first to have them _see_ through their own hothouse attitudes, which is the very counsel we are given in this kanji.",
薄,dilute,"Take a good look at this kanji: the ""strong"" element here is really the _flower_ , not the _water_ as you might have thought on first glance. To the right is the _acupuncturist_ from frame 48. Taking the key word to connote **diluting** the vital humors of the body, we can imagine our _acupuncturist_ performing his task with _flowers_ in place of needles, and using their hollow stems to pipe _water_ into the body of the patient.",
葉,leaf,"Three elements are given here: _flower_ . . . _generation_ . . . _tree_. The first and last seem logical enough, since it is the **leaf** that feeds the _flowers_ on a _tree_. The element for _generation_ interposed between the two suggests that the movement of a _tree_ from one _generation_ to the next is like its  ""turning over a new **leaf**. """,
模,imitation,"Ah, but haven't modern _graveyards_ become a parody of their ancestors! The flowers are plastic, the writing on the stones is unimaginative and cold, and the whole thing looks more like a marble orchard than a right and proper graveyard. This kanji continues with the modernization trend by picturing **imitation** _trees_ in the _graveyard_. But of course, how convenient! They don't need pruning or fertilizing, their leaves don't fall, and they remain the same color all year long.",
漠,vague,"Think of the key word as having to do with something viewed through a haze, or in the twilight and from a distance, so that only its outlines are **vaguely** discernible. Now we are back again to the essence of the true _graveyard_. The _water_ may be taken as the sound of waves dashing up against the rocks or the dripping of moisture on cold rock - anything that helps you associate **vagueness** with the _graveyard_ and keep it distinct from the imitation we met in the last frame.",
墓,grave,"The mounds of _soil_ with crude wooden crosses set at their head suggests those boot-hill **graves** we all know from cowboy lore. The only odd thing about this kanji is that the _soil_ comes UNDER the _graveyard_ , rather than to its left, where we might expect. Just think of the bodies as ""lying under boot-hill"" if you have any trouble. By the way, this is not the first time, nor will it be the last, that we learn a kanji whose key word is the same, or almost the same, as a primitive element based on it, but whose shape differs somewhat. There is no cause to worry. By using the primitive in a variety of other characters, as we have done here, the confusion will be averted as a matter of course. In most cases, as here, the primitive element is taken from a part of the fuller kanji.",
暮,livelihood,Imagine that you have chosen the occupation of the keeper of a _graveyard_ and spend your _days_ tending to other's dead hood in order to make your means of **livelihood**.,
膜,membrane,"The _part of the body_ first affected by a stroll through a haunted _graveyard_ is the skin, which gets goose bumps. But we save the word  ""skin"" for another kanji, and use the odd word "" **membrane** "" here. Think of being so scared through and through that the goose flesh moves from the outside in, giving you goose **membranes**.",
苗,seedling,"To avoid confusion with the image of rice seedlings to appear later, we shall take these **seedlings** out of their agricultural setting in the _rice fields_ and into the frame of Brave New World surgery, where  ""ideas"" or ""values"" are being implanted into _brains_ like **seedlings** to insure a harmonious society. Then you need only imagine them taking root and breaking out into _flower_ right through the tops of the skulls of people walking around on the streets.",
兆,portent,"Here we have a pictograph of the back of a turtle, the two sloping vertical strokes representing the central ridge and the four short strokes the pattern. Think of reading turtle shells as a way to foretell the future, and in particular things that **portend** coming evils.","* When this character is used as a primitive in its full form, we keep the key-word sense of a _portent_. When it appears to the left in its abbreviated form (namely, the left half only), we shall give it the pictographic sense of a _turtle_."
桃,peach tree,"To associate the **peach tree** with the primitive for a _portent_ , recall the famous Japanese legend of Momotarō, the **Peach** Boy. It begins once upon a time with a fisherman and his wife who wanted badly to have a child, but none was born to them. Then one day the old man caught a giant **peach** , out of which jumped a healthy young lad whom they named **Peach** Boy. Though the boy was destined to perform heroic deeds, his birth also _portended_ great misfortune (how else could he become a hero?). Thus the _tree_ that is associated with a _portent_ of coming evil comes to be the **peach tree**.",
眺,stare,"To give someone the ""evil _eye_ "" is to **stare** at them, wishing them evil. The roots of the superstition are old and almost universal throughout the cultures of the world. In this kanji, too, being **stared** at is depicted as an _eye_ that _portends_ evil.",
犬,dog,"We know that the character for _large_ takes on the meaning of the _St. Bernard_ **dog** when used as a primitive. In this frame we finally see why. The _drop_ added as a fourth and final stroke means that we have to do with a normal-sized **dog** , which compared to the _St. Bernard_ is no more than a _drop_ in the kennel.","* As a primitive this character can take two meanings. In the form given here it will mean a very small dog (which we shall refer to as a _chihuahua_ for convenience sake). When it takes the form 犭 to the left of a character, we shall give it the meaning of _a pack of wild dogs_."
状,status quo,"Did you ever hear of the _turtle_ who fell madly in love with a _chihuahua_ but could not have her because their two families did not like the idea of their children intermarrying? Like all classic stories of ill-fated love, this one shows how the young upset the **status quo** with an emotion older and more powerful than anything their elders have devised to counter it: blind love.",
黙,silence,"Oddly enough, the character for **silence** shows us a _black chihuahua_. Actually, the cute little critter's name is Darkness, as I am sure you remember from the famous song about **silence** that begins,  ""Hello, Darkness, my old friend...."" Note how the four dots reach all the way across the bottom of the character.",
然,sort of thing,"The key word in this frame refers to a suffix that gives the word before it an adjectival quality, hence we refer to it as "" **sort of thing**. "" Reverting to the time when dog was more widely eaten than it is today (See frame 127), we see here a large cauldron boiling over an _oven flame_ with the _flesh_ of a _chihuahua_ being thrown into the whole concoction to make it into a  ""hot- diggity, dog-diggity"" **sort of thing**.",
荻,reed,"You've no doubt seen cattails, those swamp **reeds** with a furry _flower_ to them like the tail of a cat. This might just turn out to be a good way to get rid of a troublesome _pack of wild dogs_ : lure them into a swamp of these **reeds** with the cattail _flowers_ and then set _fire_ to the swamp. Take care to focus on the _flower_ rather than the  ""cattail"" to avoid confusion with frame 259 below.",
狩,hunt,"One of the worst problems you have to face when you go **hunting** is to _guard_ your take from the _wild dogs_. If you imagine yourself failing at the task, you will probably have a stronger image than if you try to picture yourself succeeding.",
猫,cat,"Knowing how much dogs love to chase **cats** , picture a _pack of wild dogs_ planting  "" **cat** - _seedlings_ ,"" watering them, and fertilizing them until they can be harvested as a crop of **cats** for them to chase and torment. If you begin from the key word and think of a  ""crop of **cats** ,"" you will not confuse this story with the apparently similar story of two frames ago.",
牛,cow,"Can you the ""doodle"" of a **cow** that has just been run over by a steamroller? The small dot in the first stroke shows its head turned to one side, and the next two strokes, the four legs.","* As a primitive, the same sense of _cow_ is kept. Note only that when it is placed OVER another element, its tail is cut off. In this case, and when the element appears on the left, the stroke order is changed."
特,special,"Despite the strong phonetic similarity, there will be no problem keeping the key word **special** distinct from the character we met earlier for _specialty_ (Frame 47), since the latter has immediate connotations lacking in this kanji. Anyway, we shall let the key word of this frame refer to something in a **special** class all its own - like the sacred _cows_ of India that wander freely without fear of being butchered and ground into hamburger. Even though the practice is originally a Hindu one, and in any case no longer followed among the majority of Japanese Buddhist monks, the Buddha's refusal to take the life of any sentient being makes it only fitting that the _cows_ should be placed on the sacred grounds of a _Buddhist temple_ in this kanji.",
告,revelation,"Folklore throughout the world tells us of talking animals who show a wisdom superior to that of human beings, and that same tradition has found its way into television shows and cartoons right into our own century. This character depicts **revelation** through the _mouth_ of a _cow_ , suggesting oracular utterances about truths hidden to human intelligence.",
先,before,"Take this key word in its physical, not its temporal, sense (even though it refers to both). If you have a _cow_ with _human legs_ , as the elements show us here, it can only be because you have two people in a _cow_ -suit. I always thought I'd prefer to be the one standing **before** , rather than the one that holds up the rear and becomes the ""butt"" of everyone's laughter.",
洗,wash,"This character is so logical that one is tempted to let the elements speak for themselves: _water_ . . . _before_. But we have already decided we will not allow such rationalism to creep into our stories. Not even this once. Instead, let us change the character from the Peanuts comic strip called  ""Pigpen,"" who is always preceded by a little cloud of dust and grime, and rename him "" **Wash** -Out."" Everywhere he walks, a spray of _water_ goes _before_ him to sanitize everything he touches.",
介,jammed in,"The idea of something getting **jammed into** something else is depicted here by having a _walking stick_ get **jammed into** an _umbrella_ frame by someone shoving it into an already occupied slot in the _umbrella_ stand at the door. First notice the vertical strokes: on the left is the curved umbrella handle, and on the right the straight _walking stick_. Now try to imagine the two parties tugging at their respective properties like two kids on a wishbone, creating a scene at the entrance of an elegant restaurant.",
界,world,"As the **world** gets _jammed_ with more and more people, there is less and less space. Imagine yourself taking an air flight over a **world** so densely populated that every bit of it is sectioned off like a gigantic checkerboard (the _rice fields_ ). If you look closely at the character, you should be able to see a kind of movement taking place as still more is being **jammed into** that already narrow space.",
茶,tea,"As everyone knows, **tea** is made from **tea** leaves. But the **tea** plant itself has its own _flowers_ , which can be quite beautiful and add a special flavor to the _tea_ , as the Chinese found out already over 4,598 years ago. With the image of a terrace of _flowering_ **tea** bushes in mind, picture a number of brightly painted and very l-o-n-g _wooden poles_ (Frame 207) placed here and there in their midst, with a tiny _umbrella_ at the top to shade the delicate-tasting **tea** _flowers_.",
脊,spinal column,"The **spinal column** has sprouted out of the _flesh_ of your back into an _umbrella_ that you always have with you, rain or shine. The pair of 2s on each side are the  ""ribs"" of the _umbrella_. Take care to keep your image of the key word distinct from that for spine (Frame 24).",
合,fit,"The kanji for **fit** reads literally, top to bottom, as a _meeting_ of _mouths_  \- which is a rather descriptive way of speaking of a romantic kiss. We all know what happens when there is no meeting of minds and when people's ideas don't **fit**  with one another. But this kanji invites us to imagine what would happened to the romance of a certain unfortunate couple whose _mouths_ didn't **fit**.",
塔,pagoda,"On the left we see a mound of _dirt_ , and to the right _flowers_ made to _fit_ together. The two sides combine to create a great **pagoda** made of _dirt_ , with _flowers_ by the tens of thousands _fitted_ together for the roofing of each of the layers. Be sure to put yourself in the scene and _fit_ a few of the _flowers_ in place yourself so that the image works its way into memory with full force.",
王,king,See what you can do to come up with a pictograph of a **king's** scepter here that suits your own idea of what it should look like. You might even begin with the basic element for _I beam_ and then try to fit the remaining third stroke in.,"* As a primitive, this can mean either _king_ or _scepter_ , but it will usually be taken to mean _ball,_  as an abbreviation of the character in the next frame."
玉,jewel,"Note the _drop_ here in the king's _scepter_ , which is exactly what you would expect it to be: a precious **jewel** handed down from of old as a symbol of his wealth and power.","* As a primitive, we can use this to mean either _jewel_ or _ball_. When it appears anywhere other than on the left side of a kanji, it takes the same shape as here. On the left, it will be lacking the final stroke, making it the same as the character in the previous frame."
宝,treasure,"Every _house_ has its **treasure** , as every thief knows only too well. While the things we **treasure** most are usually of sentimental value, we take the original sense of the term **treasure** here and make it refer to _jewels_ kept in one's _house_.",
珠,pearl,"Take care to keep the meaning of this kanji distinct from that for _jewel_. Think of the most enormous **pearl** you have ever seen, a great _vermilion_ -colored _ball_ sitting on your ring and making it extremely difficult to move without falling over from the weight of the thing.",
現,present,"Do not think of a ""gift"" here, but of the **present** moment, as distinct from the future and the past. The kanji gives us a _ball_ in which we see the **present**  \- obviously a crystal _ball_ that enables us to _see_ things going on at the **present** in faraway places.",
玩,toy,"If, at some aboriginal level, **Toys** Я Us, then the archetypal _ball_ must have been there at the _beginning_ , before evolving into beach balls, ping- pong balls, rugby balls, and marbles.",
狂,lunatic,"A **lunatic** is literally one driven mad by the light of the moon, and the most famous of the  "" **looneys** "" are the legendary lycanthropes or ""wolfmen."" Sometimes the transformation is only a temporary phenomenon, sometimes it is permanent. In the latter case, the poor chap takes off on all fours to live with the beasts. To remember this kanji, imagine one of these lycanthropes going **looney** and setting himself up as _king_ of a _pack of wild dogs_ that roams about and terrorizes innocent suburban communities.",
旺,effulgent,"The radiant, **effulgent** splendor of he _sun_ makes it _king_ of all the planets and other stars. Just to be sure you don't take this too abstractly, picture the _sun_ seated on a throne, flourishing its _scepter_ this way and that.",
皇,emperor,"An **emperor** , as we all know, is a ruler - something like a _king_ but higher in status. The _white bird_ perched above the _king_ , elevating him to **imperial** heights, is the messenger he sends back and forth to the gods to request advice and special favors, something that _white birds_ have long done in folklore throughout the world.",
呈,display,"The trick to remembering this character lies in associating the key word with the line from the nursery rhyme about 4 and 20 blackbirds baked in a pie: ""Wasn't this a dainty dish to set before the _king_? "" If we think of **display** in terms of that famous line, and the _king_ with his head thrown back and his _mouth_ wide open as 4 and 20 blackbirds fly in one after the other, we shall have satisfied both the elements and their position.",
全,whole,"**Wholeness** suggests physical and spiritual health,  ""having your act together."" The kanji-image for **wholeness** depicts being  "" _king_ under your own _umbrella_ ,"" that is, giving order to your own life. I know it sounds terribly abstract, but what could be more abstract than the word **whole**?",
栓,plug,"Here we think of **plug** in the sense of a cork or stopper used to seal the mouth of a bottle, water faucet, or something with liquid running out of it. Forgetting the abstract picture of the former frame, let us work with all the primitive units: _tree_ . . . _umbrella_ . . . _ball_. Imagine a _tree_ with a faucet in the side out of which tennis _balls_ are flowing, bouncing all over the ground by the hundreds. You fight your way up to it and shove your giant beach _umbrella_ into the _tree_ to **plug** it up.",
理,logic,"We first referred to this character back in frame 185, to which you might want to return to have a peek. The image of **logic** we are given is something like a central _jewel_ in a _computer_ , like the _jewels_ in old clocks that keep them running smoothly. Try to picture yourself making your way through all the rams and roms and approaching this shining _jewel_ , a chorus of voice sand a blast of trumpets in the background heralding the great seat of all- knowing **logic**.",
主,lord,"A man's home is his castle, goes the proverb from an age where it was the male who was **lord** of the household. Fundamentally, it means only that every one of us is a bit (or _drop_ ) of a _king_ in our own environment. As for the positioning of the elements, if you take care to  ""read off"" the primitives in this way, you won't end up putting the _drop_ down below, where it turns the kanji into a jewel.","* As a primitive element, we set the key word aside entirely and take it as a pictograph of a solid brass _candlestick_ (with the drop representing the flame at the top)."
注,pour,"Picture **pouring** water from a lighted _candlestick_. What could be more ridiculous, or simpler, as a way to recall this kanji?",
柱,pillar,The **pillar** referred to here is the _wooden_ beam that stands at the entrance to a traditional Japanese house. Carve it in imagination into the shape of a gigantic _candlestick_ and your work is done.,
金,gold,"If this were not one of the most common characters you will ever have to write, I would apologize for having to give the explanation that follows. Anyway, we want to depict bars of **gold** bullion with an _umbrella_ overhead to shade them from the heat (and perhaps to hide them as well). The bullion is made by melting down all the _scepters_ of the kingdom, _drop_ by _drop_ , and shaping them into bars.","* As a primitive, it means not only _gold_ but any _metal_ at all."
銑,pig iron,"**Pig iron** refers to iron in the crude form in which it emerges from the smelting furnaces. Of all the various forms _metal_ can take, this one shows us _metal_ _before_ it has been refined. Imagine two photographs labeled  "" _before_ "" and ""after"" to show the process.",
鉢,bowl,"Let **bowl** suggest a large and heavy _golden_ **bowl** into which you are throwing all the _books_ you own to mash them into pulp, for some outrageous reason you will have to think up yourself.",
銅,copper,"Picture an order of _monks_ serving as chaplains for the police force. Their special habit, made of protective _metal_ , is distinguished by a row of **copper** buttons just like the  "" **cops** "" they serve.",
釣,angling,"The character we learned for _fishing_ (Frame 184) refers to the professional, net-casting industry, while the **angling** of this character refers to the sport. The odd thing is that your **angling** rod is a _golden_ _ladle_ which you are using to scoop _gold_ fish out of a river.",
針,needle,"In frame 10 we referred ahead to this full character from which the primitive for _needle_ (on the right) derives. Since we already expect that **needles** are made of _metal_ , let us picture a set of solid _gold_ darning **needles** to complete the kanji.",
銘,inscription,Take **inscription** in the sense of the _name_ you ask the jeweler to carve on a _gold_ bracelet or inside a _gold_ ring to identify its owner or communicate some sentimental message. It will help if you can recall the first time you had this done and the feelings you had at the time.,
鎮,tranquillize,"The first lie-detector machines of the twentieth century worked by wiring pieces of _metal_ to the body to measure the amount of sweat produced when questions were asked. It was discovered that nervousness produced more sweat, indicating subconscious reactions when the _truth_ was getting too close for comfort. Nowadays, people can take drugs that **tranquillize** them in such a way as to neutralize the effect of the device, which is why other means have had to be developed.",
道,road-way,"The key word carries both the sense of a **road** for transit and a **way** or method of doing something, but the former is better for forming an image. The primitives read: the _neck_ of a _road_. Think of a crowded **road-way** where traffic has come to a standstill - what we commonly refer to as a  ""bottle _neck_. """,
導,guidance,"When we accept someone's **guidance** , we permit ourselves to be _glued_ to a certain _road_ or _way_ of doing something, and try to  ""stick"" to it.",
辻,crossing,"Take the first two strokes in the sense we gave them back in frame 10, as the pictograph of a _cross_ , and set it on a _road_ to create a  "" **crossing**. """,
迅,swift,"Here we see a _crossing_ in the form of a barbed _fishhook_ , suggesting a **swifter** alternate not only to the roundabouts used in Europe but also to the  ""cloverleaf"" design used on superhighways in the United States.",
造,create,Think of **creating** as making something out of nothing. Then recall how the _way_ of _revelation_ laid out in the Bible begins with the story of how God **created** the world out of a dark and chaotic nothingness.,
迫,urge,"To **urge** someone to do something, you make the _way_ as appealing as possible, perhaps even _white_ washing it a bit.",
逃,escape,"When **escaping** from something or someone, one always feels as if one is not going fast enough, like a _turtle_ on an expressway. (Since the _turtle_ is on the _road_ and not on the left, it can keep its full kanji shape as given in frame 250.)",
辺,environs,"To keep the **environs** clean and safe, you could cement _daggers_  in the _road_ , blades pointed upwards, so that no polluting traffic could pass by. You could, if you were an ecologically-minded terrorist.",
巡,patrol,A virtual  _flood_ of motorcycle police washing down a _road_ is this kanji's image for a **patrol**.,
車,car,"You may keep the whole range of connotations for this keyword, **car** , provided it does not interfere with the pictograph. Look for the front and back wheels (the first and last horizontal strokes) and the seat in the carriage in the middle. As an exercise, try to isolate the primitives on your own and make a story out of them.","* _Car_ , _cart_ , _wagon_ , and _vehicle_ may all be used as primitive meanings."
連,take along,What you are meant to **take along** in this kanji are not things but people. The image of the _car_ on the _road_ should ground your image for picking up your friends to _take_ them _along_ to wherever you are going.,
軌,rut,Combine the primary and secondary meanings of this keyword to form your story. Begin with the _car_ whose tires get caught in a **rut** and spin without going anywhere. Then go onto the _baseball team_ who can't win a game because it has fallen into a **rut** of losing.,
輸,transport,"On the left we see a _vehicle_ used for **transport**. On the right, we see a new tangle of elements that need sorting out. The first three strokes, you will remember, are the primitive for _meeting_. Below it we see the elements for _flesh_ and _saber_ , which combine to create a compound element for a _butcher_ and his trade. Together they give us the image of a  ""trucker's convoy.""",
喩,metaphor,People who try to sound literary often end up butchering the language. Here we see a _meeting_ of _butchers_ whose _mouths_ are producing the **metaphors**.,
前,in front,"We waited to introduce this character until now, even though the pieces have been available for some time, because it helps to reinforce the odd kanji of the last frame. Picture the _butcher_ hacking away with his knife at a slab of meat on his table with a pair of ram's _horns_ placed **in front** of him (or on his head, if you prefer). There is no need to worry about confusing this kanji with that for _before_ (Frame 263), since it will not appear as a primitive in any other character used in this book.",
煎,roast,"Think of **roasting** the guest of honor at a party - literally, in _front_ of an _oven-fire_.",
各,each,"Suum cuique goes the popular Latin proverb. A certain disease of the English language makes it almost impossible to translate the phrase without gender bias. In any event, here we see someone walking with his/her _mouth_ between his/her _walking legs_ , giving us an image of ""To **each** his/her own. ""","* The sense of the proverb should help when using this kanji as a primitive, otherwise, reduce it to its original elements. But do not associate it in any way with the word ""every,"" which we shall meet later in another context."
格,status,"If you can imagine _trees_ as **status** symbols (as they might well be for those living in Japan's congested cities, where greenery has become something of a luxury item), then _each_ might be aiming to have his/her own _tree_ , just to keep up with the Suzukis.",
賂,graft,"To those who believe in the inevitability of **graft** in government, everything has a price - or as this character has it, to _each_ office its outlay of _shells_.",
略,abbreviation,"_Each field_ has its own **abbreviations** (chemistry, philosophy, sports, etc.). Needless to say, the  ""stronger"" primitive - thatis to say, the simpler and more often used one - takes the dominant position on the left, even though the story would read them off the other way around.",
客,guest,"When you are a **guest** in a courteous town, _each house_ hold has its own way of welcoming you, and _each house_ becomes your home.",
額,forehead,"As Miss Manners will be the first to tell you, out of respect, one does not look straight into the eyes of one's _guests_ , but focus on the top button of their collar. Here, however, you are told to look above the eyes to the **forehead** of your _guest_.",
夏,summer,"In the **summer** , fatigued by the heat, your _head_ hangs down nearly as far as your _walking legs_ , or rather, your ""dragging legs."" Note how the _walking legs_ (instead of  ""animal legs"") are the only thing that distinguishes this character from that for _page_ (Frame 64).",
処,dispose,"Both the stretching out of the _walking legs_ and the little bit of _wind_ tucked in on the right suggest using one's legs to kick something out of the way, or **dispose** of it.",
条,twig,"Geppetto made _walking legs_ for his little Pinocchio from two **twigs** of a _tree_ , giving him a set of "" **twiggy** "" shanks.",
落,fall,"When _water_ **falls** , it splats and splashes, when _flower_ petals **fall** , they float gently in the breeze. To _each_ thing its own way of **falling**.",
冗,superfluous,"Picture a _weather vane_ beneath a regal _crown_ , spinning round and round. It is not only **superfluous** but makes a perfect ass out of the one who wears it.",
冥,Hades,"The key word in this frame refers to the underworld, the world of the dead. By way of the classic Greek association, it is also used for the ""dwarf planet"" Pluto. Since no one knows precisely when this part of the cosmos was finished, we may imagine it as the _crowning_ deed of _day six_ of the creation.",
軍,army,"The _crowned vehicle_ depicted here is a  "" _chariot_ ,"" symbol of an **army**.",* Used as a primitive this kanji means only _chariot_.
輝,radiance,Take advantage of the first syllable of the key word to think of the _ray_ of light to the left. Now add the glittering _chariot_ that is emitting those _rays_ and you have **radiance**.,
運,carry,"A long string of ""sweet"" _chariots_ ""swinging low"" to our _roads_ is a sure sign that the Lord is  ""comin' for to **carry** "" someone home.",
冠,crown,"By having the **crown** pass from one age to the next, a people keeps itself _glued_ to its _beginnings_.",
夢,dream,"To have a **dream** after going to bed is really the _crown_ to a perfect _evening_. The _flower_ petals over the _eyes_ (instead of the  ""sand"" that Westerners are used to finding there when they awake in the morning) only confirms the image of a pleasant **dream** suggested by the rest of this rather complex kanji.",
坑,pit,A _whirlwind_ begins to dig its way into the _soil_ like a drill until it makes a deep **pit**.,
高,tall,"Recalling an image from frame 195, first see the _mouth_ under the extraterrestrial's glass _hood_ , and then the _mouth_ under the _top hat_ of one of his mates who has tried on the strange earthling's headgear only to find that it makes him look much, much **taller** than everyone else.","* As a primitive, this character keeps its sense of _tall_ and its position at the top of other primitives, but its writing is abbreviated to the first 5 strokes."
享,receive,"_Tall children_ **receive** more attention. _Tall children_ grow up to make better wide **receivers**. Take your pick, depending on whether you prefer child psychology or American football. At any rate, be sure you have some particular _tall child_ in mind, someone who really was outstanding and always attracting attention, because he or she will come in handy in the next two frames.",
塾,cram school,"**Cram schools** are after-hours educational institutions where kids can do concentrated preparing for their coming entrance examinations or drill what they missed during regular class hours. The exception are the _tall children_ who are out on the school _grounds_ practicing sports, and the _fat_ ones who are out there burning off calories. So this character depicts those who do NOT go to the **cram schools** , rather than those who do.",
熟,mellow,The _tall_ and _fat children_ from the last frame are here cast into a cauldron over an _oven flame_ until they have sufficiently **mellowed** that they can return to the normal life of a student.,
亭,pavilion,"Think of all the **pavilions** at County Fairs or World Expos you have wandered into or seen advertised in the media, and you will no doubt see rising up among them the towering _tall crowned nail_ (the _crown_ being a revolving restaurant) - that architectural monstrosity that has become a symbol of science and technology at such events.",
京,capital,When we think of a **capital**  city today we think of _tall_  skyscrapers dwarfing the endless swarms of _little_  folk scurrying here and there about their business.,
涼,refreshing,"Since few things are as **refreshing** on a warm day as a cool shower (the _water_ ), here we picture an entire _capital_ city treating itself to one, and in full view of everyone.",
景,scenery,"**Scenery** is depicted as a _sun_ rising over a _capital_  city, which is a bit of natural **scenery**  the city dwellers themselves rarely get to see!",
鯨,whale,"The **whale** swallows a whole school of fish, who turn their new abode into a proper little _fish-capital_.",
舎,cottage,A _lidded crock_ with an _umbrella_ overhead gives us a mixture of the modern and the nostalgic in this design for a **cottage**.,
周,circumference,"Look more closely at your _lidded crock_ and you will see little ruler marks along its bottom edge. This is so you can use it to calculate the **circumference** of your _motorcycle helmet_ : just begin at a fixed point and turn the _lidded crock_ around and around, keeping it flush against the side of the _helmet_ , until you come back to your starting point. If you kept track of how many turns and part-turns your _lidded crock_ made, you now know the **circumference**.","* As a primitive, this character can take the added significance of a _lap_."
週,week,"Picture a circular _road_ with 7 markers on it, one for each day of the **week**. When you have walked one complete _lap_ on this _road_ , you shall have completed one **week**.",
士,gentleman,"The shape of this kanji, slightly differing from that for _soil_ by virtue of its shorter final stroke, hints at a broad-shouldered, slender-waisted warrior standing at attention. When feudalism collapsed, these warriors became Japan's **gentlemen**.","* The primitive meaning reverts to the more colorful image of the _samurai_ , Japan's warrior class."
吉,good luck,"Here we see a _samurai_ standing on a street with an open _mouth_ , which people walk up to and look down deep inside of for **good luck**.","* As a primitive, we shall take this shape to mean an _aerosol can_ , from the _mouth_ and the very tightly-fitting _lid_ (note how it differs here from the _lidded crock_ )."
壮,robust,**Robust** is seen as a _turtle_ turned _samurai_.,
荘,villa,"The **villa** pictured here is filled with exotic _flowers_ at every turn, and has a pair of _turtle-samurai_ standing before its gates.",
売,sell,"A _samurai_ , out of a job, is going door-to-door **selling** little windup _crowns_ with _human legs_ that run around on the floor looking like headless monarchs.",
学,study,"The _child_ in the little red _schoolhouse_ is there for one reason only: to **study**. Anyone who has gone through the schooling system knows well enough that **study** is one thing and _learning_ quite another again. In the kanji, too, the character for _learning  _(Frame 616) has nothing to do with the _schoolhouse_.",
覚,memorize,"The idea of **memorizing** things is easily related to the _schoolhouse_ , and since we have been at it for more than a hundred pages in this book, the idea that **memorizing** involves _seeing_ things that are not really there should make it easy to put the two elements together.",
栄,flourish,"The botanical connotations of the word **flourish** (to bud and burst into bloom, much as a _tree_ does) are part of the ideal of the _schoolhouse_ as well.",
書,write,"The sage talks rapidly with his _tongue wagging in his mouth_ , while the _brush_ of the scribe runs apace to **write** down the master 'swords.",
津,haven,"Seeing the tiny boats of poor mortals tossed about in a stormy sea like so many corks, the All-Merciful took its _brush_ and drew little inlets of _water_ where the hapless creatures might seek shelter. And so it is that we have **havens**.",
牧,breed,"When it is time to **breed** new cattle, the bull is usually willing but the _cow_ is often not. Thus the _taskmaster_ to the right forces the _cow_ into a compromising position, so to speak, so that she and her mate can **breed**.",
攻,aggression,"The special _craft_ of successful _taskmasters_ is their ability to remain constantly on the **aggressive** , never allowing their underlings a moment to ponder a counter- **aggression** of their own.",
敗,failure,The _taskmaster_ is acknowledging the **failure** of a _clam_ to make the grade in some marine school or other.,
枚,a sheet of,"English counts thin, flat objects, like bed linen and paper, in **sheets**. The kanji does this with a _taskmaster_ whipping a _tree_ into producing **sheets** against its will.",
故,happenstance,"Call it fate or providence or plain old Lady Luck, **happenstance** is the _oldest taskmaster_ we know. It nearly always has its way.",
敬,awe,"Standing in **awe** of someone, you get self-conscious and may try to speak in _flowery phrases_ out of veneration or fear. The _taskmaster_ at the right is drilling you in the practice of your  ""honorifics.""",
言,say,"Of all the things we can do with our _mouths_ , speech is the one that requires the greatest distinctness and clarity. Hence the kanji for **say** has four little sound-waves, indicating the complexity of the achievement.","* This kanji, which appears often as a primitive, can mean _saying_ , _speech_ , or _words_ , depending on which is most useful."
警,admonish,"Here you have a perfect example of how an apparently impossible snarl of strokes becomes a snap to learn once you know its elements. The idea of being **admonished** for something already sets up a superior-inferior relationship between you and the person you are supposed to stand in _awe_ of. While you are restricted to answering in honorifics, the superior can use straightforward and ordinary _words_.",
計,plot,_Words_ and a meter's _needle_ combine to form the sense of **plot** : to talk over plans and to calculate a course of action.,
詮,elucidate,"Think of **elucidating** as presenting something in _whole words_ , as distinct from broken fragmented sentences.",
獄,prison,"Although we did not make note of it at the time, the kanji for _dog_ is also a low-grade term for a spy. And later (Frame 1517) we will meet another association of criminals with _dogs_. The **prison** here depicts a _pack of wild dogs_ (the long-timers and hardened criminals) into which the poor little c _hihuahua_ (first offender) has been cast. The only thing he has to protect himself against the pack are his shrill and frightened _words_.",
訂,revise,"After completing the first draft, you **revise** it by _nailing_ down your _words_ and  ""hammering"" them into shape.",
訃,obituary,"The _words_ of this **obituary** work like a _magic wand_ , conjuring up the desceased.",
討,chastise,_Words_ spoken to **chastise** us stick to us like _glue_ in a way no other _words_ can.,
訓,instruction,"The personalism connoted by the word **instruction** , as opposed to ""teaching"" or ""discipline,"" suits the picture here of _words_ guiding one's progress like the gentle flowing of a _stream_. Even the etymology of the word **instruction** suggests the sense of  ""pouring into"".",
詔,imperial edict,"The **imperial edict** , spoken with the force of unquestionable law, is made up of _words_ intended to _seduce_ the masses - be it through fear or respect - to follow obediently.",
詰,packed,"A piece of writing that is pregnant with meaning and needs to be reread several times to be understood we refer to colloquially as "" **packed**. "" The character sees the _words_ as sealed tightly inside an _aerosol can_.",
話,tale,"That the _words_ of the _tongue_ should come to mean a **tale** is clear from the etymology: a **_tale_** is something  ""talked,"" not something read from a book.",
詠,recitation,Listening to the _words_ of poets **reciting** their poetry is like being transported for a moment into _eternity_ where the rules of everyday life have been suspended.,
詩,poem,"Since silence is treasured so highly at a _Buddhist temple_ the _words_ spoken there must be well-chosen. Perhaps this is why the records of the monks often read to us like **poems**. Before going on, back up a frame and make sure you have kept **poem** and _recitation_ distinct in your mind.",
語,word,"Whereas the character for _say_ focused on the actual talking, that for **words** stresses the fact that although it is _I_ who _say_ them, the **words** of a language are not my own. You can see the clear distinction between _I_ and **words** just by looking at the kanji.",
読,read,"In the age of advertising, most _words_ we **read** are out to _sell_ some product or point of view.",
調,tune,A complete **tune** is composed not only of a succession of notes but also of one _lap_ of the _words_ that go with it.,
談,discuss,"In almost every attempt to **discuss** an issue, the fervor of one's convictions comes to the surface and creates an _inflammation_ of _words_ (if you will, the  ""cuss"" in **discuss** ).",
諾,consent,"The _words_ of the _young_ do not have legal validity unless backed up by ""parental **consent**. """,
諭,rebuke,"The stern tone of a **rebuke** is seen here in the image of _words_ spoken at a _meeting_ of _butchers_ (See frame 307) waving their choppers at one another and  ""cutting one another down"" as only _butchers_ can.",
式,style,"Take **style** in its sense of some fashion design or model. Then let the element _arrow_ and _craft_ stand for the well-known **style** of shirts known as  "" _Arrow_ shirts "" because of the little _arrow_ sewn on each one.",
試,test,"When a manufacturer produces a new _style_ for the market, the first thing that is done is to run a **test** on consumers, asking them to _speak_ their opinions frankly about the product. Never mind the anachronism (the kanji was there well before our capitalistic market system) if it helps you remember.",
弐,II (two),"We use the Roman numeral II here to stress that this kanji is an older form of the kanji for _two_. Think of _two_ arrows in a _quiver_ , standing up like the numeral II.",
域,range,"From its original meaning of a defined area or zone, a **range** has also come to mean a grazing _land_ where cowboys roam and do whatever it is they do with cows. When the herds have all been driven to market, there is a great homecoming _fiesta_ like that pictured here. As soon as the cowboys come home, home on the **range** , the first thing they do is kiss the ground (the _mouth_ on the _floor_ ), and then get on with the _fiesta_.",
賊,burglar,"From a **burglar's** point of view, a _fiesta_ is an occasion to takeout the old lock picking _needle_ and break into the unattended safe filled with the family _shells_ (the old form of money, as we saw in frames 84 and 206).",
栽,plantation,On a fruit **plantation** it is the _trees_ that one is particularly grateful for at the time of _Thanksgiving_. Imagine yourself inviting a few representative _trees_ from the fields and orchards to join you around the table to give thanks.,
載,load,One **loads** bales on a wagon or _cart_ in preparation for the great Hay Ride that follows the _Thanksgiving_ dinner each year.,
茂,overgrown,"The sense of the key word **overgrown** is of something growing luxuriously, though not necessarily in excess - in this case a whole _parade_ of weeds (outcast   _flowers_ ). By way of exception, the _flowers_ take their normal place over the enclosure.",
戚,relatives,"If you think of a _parade_ of particularly disagreeable **relatives** , it should not be hard to imagine them as large bodies with _little_ pea-brains _above_.",
成,turn into,"Let the phrase "" **turn into** "" suggest some sort of a magical change. What happens here is that the _parade_ marching down main street **turns into** a _dagger_ -throwing bout between competing bands. Note how only one stroke has to be added to make the change.",
城,castle,"In this frame, we see a mound of _dirt_ that is being _turned into_ a **castle** (the way you may have done as a child playing on the beach).",
誠,sincerity,The sure sign of **sincerity** is that one's mere _words_ are _turned into_ deeds.,
威,intimidate,"Here we see a _march_ of _women_ demonstrating on behalf of equal rights, something extremely **intimidating** to the male chauvinist population.",
滅,destroy,"Picture a _march_ of _flames_ demonstrating against the Fire Department for their right to **destroy** , but being doused with _water_ by the police riot squads.",
減,dwindle,"A group of unquenchable _mouths_ sets out on a _march_ across the country, drinking _water_ wherever they find it until the _water_ supply has **dwindled** to a trickle, triggering a national disaster.",
蔑,revile,"The verbal abuse involved in **reviling** those who do not deserve it can be compared to a _march of flowers_ in full boom having an _eyeball_ of nastiness cast over them (literally, of course).",
桟,scaffold,"Prior to the use of metal, _trees_ were once cut down and bound together for use as **scaffolding** material. In the case of this kanji, what is being constructed is not a skyscraper but a simple _float_.",
銭,coin,Those special _gold_ -colored tokens minted each year for the Mardi Gras and thrown into the crowds from people on the _floats_ give us the kanji for **coins**.,
浅,shallow,An entourage of _floats_ going from one town to the next must always seek a **shallow** place to cross the _water_. Try to picture what happens if they don't.,
止,stop,"The character for **stop** is easiest to learn as a pictograph, though you have to take a moment to see it. Take it as a rather crude drawing of a footprint: the first 3 strokes represent the front of the foot and the last the heel. The big toe (stroke 2 sticking out to the right) on the right indicates that this is a left foot.","* Although the meaning of _stop_ will be retained, we will return often to the pictographic meaning of _footprint_."
歩,walk,_Footprints_ that follow one another a _few_ at a time indicate **walking**.,
渉,ford,To **ford** a body of _water_ means to _walk_ across it.,
頻,repeatedly,"The image of something occurring **repeatedly** , over and over again, is of having one's _head walked_ on.",
肯,agreement,Seeing _footprints_ on someone's _flesh_ indicates a rather brutal way of having secured that person's **agreement**.,
企,undertake,To **undertake** a project is to take some idea floating in the air and _stop_ it so that it can be brought down to earth and become a reality. Here we see some **undertaking** made to _stop_ under a beach _umbrella_.,
歴,curriculum,"That same _grove of trees_ we met in frame 226 shows up here in the character for **curriculum** (in the sense of a record of one's life or academic achievements, the **curriculum** vitae). Instead of the _grove_ making its way slowly through the surface of the _cliff_ as before, here we see it _stopped_ , much the same as a **curriculum** vitae calls a halt to the calendar and talks only about the past.",
武,warrior,"With a _quiver_ of _arrows_ set on one's back, the goal of the **warrior** depicted here is not to attack but merely to _stop_ the attack of others: the oldest excuse in history!",
賦,levy,"A certain portion of _shells_ (money) is collected by the _warrior_ from the local villages as he passes through to defray the costs of keeping the land safe, and this is called a **levy**.",
正,correct,"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, says the Chinese proverb. Here we see _one footprint_ , complementing that proverb with the sound advice that if the first step is not made **correctly** , the whole point of the journey will be forfeited. This is the ideal that teachers are supposed to have in **correcting** their students, and parents in **correcting** their children.",
証,evidence,"_Words_ that testify to the _correctness_ of some fact are classified as **evidence**. (Here we see a good example of how the more common primitive element takes the  ""strong"" position to the left, even though it has more strokes.)",
政,politics,"To the many definitions for **politics** that already exist, this character offers yet another: _correct taskmastering_. Think about what the primitives tell us. On the one hand, we see the pessimistic wisdom that **politics** has to do with _taskmastering_ , maneuvering people with or without their will. And on the other, we see the campaign assurances that this duty can be performed _correctly_ if only the right candidate is given a chance.",
定,determine,"**Determination** , in the sense of settling on a certain course of action, is likened here to _mending_ one's _house_.",
錠,lock,_Metal_ of itself doesn't **lock**. It needs to be so _determined_ by a **lock** smith. Now make a concrete image of that.,
走,run,"**Running** , we are told here, _mends_ the _soil_. Observe in the following frames how this kanji can embrace other elements from below, much the same way as the element for _road_ does, and how, in order to do this, the final stroke needs to be lengthened.",
超,transcend,"When one is _running_ after something, the goal that _seduces_ one is said to **transcend** the seeker.",
赴,proceed,"In **proceeding** to a new city or a new job, something in you _runs_ ahead with excitement, and something else holds you back, like a _divining rod_ built into your psyche warning you to check things out carefully before rushing in too wildly.",
越,surpass,"Here we see two _parades_ in competition, each trying to **surpass** the other by _running_ at high speed from one town to the next. Note the little  ""hook"" at the end of the first stroke of the element for _parade_. This is the ONLY time it appears like this in the kanji treated in this book.",
是,just so,"In this kanji we are shown someone spending an entire _day_ at _mending_ one stocking, because they want the job done  "" **just so**. "" Be sure to make a clear image of a finicky old fusspot to make the abstract idea as concrete as possible.",
題,topic,"In many kinds of research, one can find information on a given **topic** only if the _headings_ are prepared _just so_.",
堤,dike,A **dike** is a successful bit of engineering only if the amount of _earth_ piled up is measured _just so_ for the height and pressure of the water it is meant to contain.,
建,build,"To construct a **building** , you first draw a set of plans (the writing _brush_ ) and then _s-t-r-e-t-c-h_ your drawing out to scale in reality.",
鍵,key,The _golden_ **key** you have been presented by the mayor gives you access to all the _buildings_  in the city.,
延,prolong,"This character is a kind of pictographic image of how **prolonging** is a clever way of _stopping_ things by trying to _stretch_ them out a little bit at a time (the extra _drop_ at the top of _stop_ ). Be sure to get a concrete image of this process, by imagining yourself **prolonging** something you can really, physically, _stretch_.",
誕,nativity,"The key word of course calls to mind the feast of Christmas. As the famous poem at the start of St. John's gospel tells us, the **nativity** we celebrate at Christmas had its origins at the very start of time and governs all of human history: it represents the _prolongation_ of the eternal _Word_ in time and space.",
礎,cornerstone,"This character depicts a **cornerstone** as a _stone_ set at the end of a wildlife preserve (the  "" _zoo_ in the _grove_ "").",
婿,bridegroom,"What makes a man a **bridegroom** is obviously a _woman_ and her dowry, here presented as a small _zoo_ (animals were often used for this purpose in earlier societies) and a _month_ away from it all (the  ""honey _moon_ "").",
衣,garment,"At the top we see the _top hat_ , and at the bottom a pictographic representation of the folds of a **garment**. If you break the  ""4-fold"" fold into 2 sets of 2 strokes, you will find it easier to remember.","* Used as a primitive, the additional meanings of _cloak_ or _scarf_ will come in handy. What has to be noted particularly are the changes in shape the kanji can undergo when it becomes an element in other kanji. In fact, it is the most volatile of all the kanji we shall treat, and for that reason deserves special attention here. When it appears to the left, it looks like a hiragana ne (ネ) with an extra drop on the right, and we shall take it to mean _cloak_.  At the bottom, when attached to the stroke immediately above it, the first two strokes (the _top hat_ ) are omitted, which we shall take to mean a _scarf_. On rare occasions, the element can be torn right across the middle, with the first 2 strokes appearing at the top and the last 4 at the bottom of another primitive or cluster of primitive, in which cases we shall speak of a _top hat and scarf_. And finally, of course, it can keep its original kanji shape, along with its original meaning of _garment_ in general. Note that when any of the above forms have something beneath them (as in frame 429), the third from final stroke is  ""unhooked."""
裁,tailor,You might think here of _garment_ that have been specially **tailored** for _Thanksgiving_ celebrations to look like traditional Pilgrim garb.,
装,attire,"The character for **attire** can be remembered as a picture of what we may call a  "" _turtle-samurai_ "" sweater. At the top we see the _turtle-samurai_ and at the bottom the element for _garment_.",
裏,back,"An innocent looking _top hat and scarf_ lying there in front of you, turned over, reveal a hidden _computer_ sewn into the **back** of each - obviously the tools of a master spy. Such experiences teach one always to have a look at the **back** side of things.",
壊,demolition,"The right half of this character shows a _garment_ woven so fine that it can pass through the _eye_ of a _needle_ , fittingly draped around the slithering, ethereal form of a poltergeist. In this frame, our eerie visitor brushes its robes against a nearby block of apartments and completely **demolishes** them, razing them to the _ground_.",
哀,pathetic,A drunken sod in a tattered _top hat_ and soiled silk _scarf_ with a giant _mouth_ guzzling something or other gives us a **pathetic** character role in which W. C. Fields might find himself right at home.,
遠,distant,A **distant** figure on the _road_ is such a blur it looks like a _lidded crock_ wearing a silk _scarf_.,
猿,monkey,"This clever little **monkey** has captured an entire pack of _wild dogs_ , locked them inside a _lidded crock_ , and wrapped the whole thing up in a silk _scarf_ to present to the dogcatcher.",
初,first time,"The primitives here take care of themselves: _cloak_ and _dagger_ .What I leave to you is to decide on an appropriate connotation for  "" **first time** "" to take advantage of them.",

布,linen,"The maid, _towels by her side_ , distributes the **linen**.",
帆,sail,A **sail** made of a _towel_ makes a _mediocre_ vessel.,
幅,hanging scroll,A _towel_ owned by the _wealthiest_ tycoon in the world is made into a **hanging scroll** after his death and auctioned off to the highest bidder.,
帽,cap,"Because of the _risk_ involved (of getting the _sun_ in one's _eyes_ ),one puts together a makeshift **cap** out of a dirty old _towel_.",
幕,curtain,A dirty _towel_ draped over the entrance to the old _graveyard_ is painted to look like the **curtain** of death that leads to the otherworld.,
幌,canopy,A large _towel_ stretched overhead with only a few of the _sun's rays_ breaking through represents a **canopy** over one's bed.,
錦,brocade,A strip of _white towel_ and some scraps of _metal_ have the makings of a primitive kind of **brocade**.,
市,market,"Dressed in nothing but a bath _towel_ and _top hat_ , one sets off to the **market** place in search of a bargain or two.",
柿,persimmon,"Imagine a village _market_  with stalls set up around an immense **persimmon** _tree_  with watermelon-sized fruit. If it weren't for the fact that the _tree_  is sacred to the village, people would get impatient as the **persimmons**  fall from the _tree_  and wreak havoc on buyers and sellers alike.",
姉,elder sister,"Of all the _women_ of the family, it is the **elder sister** who has the duty to go to _market_ to do the shopping.",
肺,lungs,"One is surprised, strolling through the _market_ , to find among the _meats_ hung out for sale a slab marked: **lungs**.",

制,system,"This kanji show a unique **system** for leading _cows_ to the slaughterer's _saber_ : one ties a _belt_ about their waist and fixes that _belt_ to an overhead cable, pulling the _cow_ up into the air where it hangs suspended, helpless against the fate that awaits it.",
製,made in...,A label indicating that a _garment_ was **made in** U.S.A. or Taiwan or Japan is itself a symbol for the _systematization_ of the _garment_ industry.,
転,revolve,"As the wheels of the _car_ **revolve** , they kick up small _rising clouds_ of dust and debris behind them.",
芸,technique,The secret **technique** of making a _rising cloud_ of smoke turn into a bouquet of _flowers_ is shown here.,
雨,rain,"This kanji, also a primitive, is one of the clearest instances we have of a complex pictograph. The top line is the sky, the next 3 strokes a pair of clouds, and the final 4 dots the **rain** collected there and waiting to fall.","* As a primitive it can mean either _rain_ or _weather_ in general. Because it takes so much space, it usually has to be contracted into a crown by shortening the second and third strokes into a crown."
雲,cloud,"Here is the full character for **cloud** from which the primitive for a _rising cloud_ derives. _Clouds_ begin with vapors _rising_ up in small _clouds_ from the surface of the earth, and then gathering to make **clouds** that eventually dump their _rain_ back on the earth.",

天,heavens,"This character is meant to be a pictograph of a great man, said to represent the Lord of the **Heavens**. (You may, of course, use the elements _ceiling_ and _St. Bernard_ instead.)","* The primitive can mean either the _heaven_ of eternal bliss or the general term for sky, the _heavens_. Pay special attention to the fact that in its primitive form the first stroke is written right to left, rather like the first stroke of thousand (Frame 40), rather than left to right. From the next character, we shall give it the primitive meaning of a _witch_."
妖,bewitched,"You are **bewitched**  by a _woman_ who is, of course, a _witch_.",

帝,sovereign,"An uncommon, but not altogether unlikely picture of a reigning **sovereign** has him _standing up_ in his _apron_ , presumably at the behest of HIS **sovereign** (she who is to be obeyed), who needs help with washing the dishes.",
諦,renunciation,"The key word **renunciation**  has to do with the wisdom and clarity of mind in knowing when to ""let go."" This is what makes the  _words_  of acquiescense _sovern_.",
童,juvenile,"This frame shows up the image of a **juvenile** hacker _standing_ on top of a _computer_ , or rather jumping up and down on it, because it refused to come up with the right answer.",
瞳,pupil,"Begin with the double meaning of the key word **pupil** : ""student"" and the ""the apple of one's _eye_. "" Now all you have to do is dwell on the phrase "" _juvenile_ of one's _eye_ "" (the meaning here) until it provides you with an image.",

匕,spoon,"This character, a pictograph of a **spoon** , is easy enough to remember, provided you keep it distinct from that for _seven_ , where the first stroke is written left to right (the opposite of here) and cuts noticeably across the second.","* As a primitive, this kanji can take on the additional meaning of someone _sitting on the ground_ , of which it can also be considered a pictograph. In general, the second stroke does not cut through the first - or if it does in some fonts, only slightly."

昆,descendants,"By _comparing_ apes with anthropoids, we not only discover the latter have **descended** from those progenitors educated in the higher branches, but that the very idea of seeing everything **descended** from everything else, one way or another, means that there is  ""nothing new UNDER the _sun_. """,
皆,all,"Think of the housewives in TV commercials "" _comparing_ the _whiteness_ "" of their laundry across the fence, a typical advertisement for the popular detergent known as **All**.

楷,block letters,"The key word refers to kanji that are written in full, squared form, as opposed to cursive writing which is more flowing andabbreviates some of the strokes.

喝,hoarse,"When the muchacho on _siesta_ looks up at you and opens his _mouth_ to talk, his voice is so **hoarse** that you cannot understand him.",
葛,kudzu,"**Kudzu**  is a word taken over from Japanese to name the crawling vines that creep up and completely take over trees. Seeing it at its worst in the Georgia countryside makes it easy to understand why it has a reputation as the ""plague of the South."" From there it should not be hard to arrange the primitives, _flowers_  and _siesta_  into a memorable image.",
旨,delicious,Something is so downright **delicious** that one spends the entire _day_ with a _spoon_ in hand gobbling it up.,
脂,fat,"This kanji tells us that if you feed the _flesh_ with too many _delicious_ things, it soon picks up a thick layer of **fat**.",

複,duplicate,"In its original and etymologically transparent sense, to **duplicate** something means to _double_ it _back_ with a fold, like the fold of a _cloak_.",
欠,lack,"The pictograph hidden in this character is of someone yawning. The first stroke shows the head thrown back, the second, the arm bent at the elbow as the hand reaches up to cover the mouth, and the last two, the legs. Since yawning shows a **lack** of something (psychologically, interest, physiologically, sleep), the connection is plain to see.","* As a primitive, it can mean either _yawn_ or _lack_."
吹,blow,To **blow** is really no more than a deliberate effort to make one's _mouth lack_ all the air that is in it.,

""","* As a primitive, this character can either retain its key word meaning of _next_ or the related meaning of _second_."
茨,briar,"Earlier we made mention of the story of **Briar** Rose (or  ""Sleeping Beauty,"" as we called her in frame 165) and drew attention to the **briar** hedge that grew up all about her castle. But in the _second_ part of the story, these **briars** blossomed into _flowers_. Hence her name, **Briar** Rose. Be careful not to confuse this character with that for _thorn_ (Frame 446).",
資,assets,"The first _shells_ (money) you earn, you use to pay your debts. From then on, the _next shells_ you accumulate become your **assets**.",
姿,figure,This kanji depicts a _woman's_ **figure** as a sort of _second_ self.,

賠,compensation,Picture a _clam_ used as a _muzzle_ to quiet the complaints of a fisherman's widow asking **compensation** for her husband lost at sea.,

音,sound,"The kanji for **sound** depicts something _standing_ in the air over a _tongue wagging in a mouth_ , much the same as a **sound** does for the briefest of moments before disappearing.",* The primitive from this kanji also means simply a sound.
暗,darkness,"When "" **darkness** covered the earth "" at the beginning of time, there was neither _sun_ nor _sound_.",
韻,rhyme,"Poetry restricted to verses that **rhyme** often finds it has to abandon clarity of thought in order to make the **rhyme** of the words work. In this kanji's picture, one becomes a kind of  "" _sound-employee_. """,

盲,blind,"If one's _eyes perish_ before death, one remains **blind** for the rest of life.",
妄,delusion,"The ""ideal _woman_ "" one daydreams about is no more than a **delusion**. Hence, _perish_ the thought of her.",
荒,laid waste,The _flowers_ that _perish_ in the _flood_ are taken here as symbols of an area that has been **laid waste**.,
望,ambition,"The story of **ambition** talks of a _king_ walking under the _perishing_  (or ""waning"") _moon_ dreaming great dreams about his kingdom. (The roots of **ambition** are from the same word as  ""ambulate,"" meaning to walk about.)",

坊,boy,"The character for a **boy** shows us a **Boy** Scout cleaning the _dirt_ out of his _compass_  \- the more _dirt_ , the better.",
芳,perfumed,Here we see a special _compass_ used to pick out those _flowers_ most suited for making good **perfumes**.,
肪,obese,"If you eat too much, you may need a _compass_ to find your way around the **obese** mass of _flesh_ that piles up in the midsection. Compare this with your stories for _round_ (Frame 44) and _fat_ (Frame 494), similar in meaning but distinct in imagery.",
訪,call on,"When making a courtesy **call on** a dignitary, one has to gauge one's _words_ with great care. Hence the need for a _compass_.",
放,set free,"The _taskmaster_ **sets** an unruly servant **free** , giving him no more than a quick glance at the _compass_ and a boot from behind.",
激,violent,"Some cosmic _taskmaster_ hovering overhead whips up the waves to make them dash **violently** against the shore. In the _white_ foam that covers the _water_ we see a broken _compass_ floating, all that remains of a shipwreck.",
脱,undress,"To **undress** is to expose the _flesh_ and tempt the _devil_ in the eyes of one's onlookers. Ignore the moral if you want, but not the _devil_.",
説,explanation,"Not inappropriately, this character likens an  **explanation** to the _devil's_ own _words_.",
鋭,pointed,"_Metal_ that has been **pointed** (as an awl, a pick, a nail, or a knife) tends to serve the _devil's_ purposes as well as civilization's: our tools are also our weapons.",
曽,formerly,"This primitive (named for its associations with the kanji of the following frame) is composed of a pair of _horns_ growing out of a _brain_ with a _tongue wagging in the mouth_ beneath. Think of  "" **former** "" in connection with administrators or heads of state who have just left office but continue to make a nuisance of themselves by advertising their opinions on public policy.","* The primitive meaning, _increase_ , comes from the next frame. Always think of something multiplying wildly as you watch."
増,increase,"This kanji depicts an **increase** of _soil_ , multiplying so fast that it literally buries everything in its path.",
贈,presents,"The **presents** offered here are _money_ that _increases_ each time you give it away. Do not confuse with the temporal word  ""present"" (Frame 275).",
東,east,"As a ""Western"" language, English identifies the **east** with the rising _sun_. In more fanciful terms, we see the _sun_ piercing through a _tree_ as it rises in the **east**.","* Both the direction _east_ and the part of the world called  ""the _East_ "" are primitive meanings of this character."
棟,ridgepole,"If the piece of _wood_ in the roof known as the **ridgepole** points _east_ , the sunrise will be visible from the front door.",
凍,frozen,"The whole secret to breaking the _ice_ with the _East_ is to peek behind those mysteriously  "" **frozen** smiles. """,
妊,pregnancy,"A _woman_ who is in her **pregnancy** is a bit like a _porter_ , bearing her new companion wherever she goes.",
廷,courts,"Those who rule the **courts** , the _porters_ of justice and order, are often found to _stretch_ the law to suit their own purposes. Recall the kanji for _prolong_ from frame 419 and keep it distinct.",
染,dye,"_Water_ . . . _nine_ . . . _tree_. From those elements you must compose a plot for the key word, **dye**. Here, as elsewhere, any of the alternate meanings of the primitives may be used, provided they do not require a position other than that of the kanji in question.",
燃,burn,"_Hearth_ . . . _sort of thing_. Beware of letting the simple reading off of the primitive elements do your work for you. Unless you make a vivid image of something **burning** and relate it just as vividly to those primitive meanings, you can count on forgetting this character very quickly.",
賓,V.I.P.,The **V.I.P.** indicated here is an important guest making a visit. The elements are: _house_ . . . _ceiling_ . . . _few_ . . . _shells_.,
歳,year-end,_Stop_ . . . _march_ . . . _little_. Be sure not to forget that final dot in the element for _march_.,
県,prefecture,"Above, an _eye_ and a _fishhook_ , and below the primitive for _little_. Although apparently the simplest of these first six kanji, when you begin to work on its plot and story you will soon find out that the number of strokes and visual complexity of a kanji does not make it easier or harder to remember. It is the primitives you have to work that are the critical factor, as in this case where the meaning of the key word is so seemingly distant from the elements. Remember, you can always break larger elements down ( _eye of a needle_ into _eye_ and _fishhook_ ) if you think it helps.",
栃,horse chestnut,A tree . . . cliff . . . ten thousand.,
地,ground,"_Soil_ and a _scorpion_ (an  ""earth animal""). This is, of course, the full character from which the primitive for **ground** derives.",
池,pond,"_Water_ . . . _scorpion_. It would be easy to slip into a  ""lazy image"" in cases like this one, picturing, let us say, a _scorpion_ near the _water_. But if you picture rather a _scorpion_ letting its venom out _drop by drop_ until it has made a whole **pond** of the stuff, the image is more likely to remain fixed.",
虫,insect,Work with the pictograph as you wish.,"* As a primitive, this insect will refer to the whole _insect_ kingdom, it can be further specified for each kanji that contains it."

蚕,silkworm,_Heavens_ . . . _insect_. Be sure to do something about the position of the two elements.,
風,wind,"_Windy_ . . . _drops of_ . . . _insects_. Hint: think of the last two primitives as representing a swarm of _gnats_ , those tiny _drops of_ pesky _insects_.",
己,self,"The kanji carries the abstract sense of the **self** , the deep-down inner structure of the human person that mythology has often depicted as a _snake_ \- which is what the kanji shows pictographically. Be sure to keep it distinct from the similar keywords, _oneself_ (frame 36) and _I_ (frame 17).","* As a primitive element, this kanji can be used for the _snake_  \- of which it is a pictograph - or any of the various concrete symbolic meanings the _snake_ has in myth and fable."
起,rouse,Run . . . snake.,
妃,queen,Woman . . . snake.,
改,reformation,"Pluralizing the _snake_ and focusing on a single _taskmaster_ may help recommend the image of Ireland's most famous **reformer** , St. Patrick, who, legend has it, drove away the _snakes_ from the land.",
記,scribe,Words . . . snake.,
包,wrap,Bind up . . . snake.,"* The primitive meaning of _wrap_ should always be used with the _snake_ in mind to avoid confusion with similar terms. Just let  "" _wrap_ "" mean ""with a snake coiled about it."""
胞,placenta,Part of the body . . . wrap.,
砲,cannon,Stones . . . wrap.,
泡,bubble,Water . . . wrap.,
亀,tortoise,"This is not a _turtle_ (See frame 250) but a **tortoise** , however you wish to picture the difference. Let the "" _bound up_ "" at the to prefer to the head, and the two _suns_ , with a long tail running through it, to the shell.","* As a primitive, this kanji is abbreviated to its bottom half, ⻲, and comes to mean _eel_. (If it is any help, this kanji in its full form can also be remembered through its abbreviation's primitive meaning.)"
電,electricity,Rain/weather . . . eel.,
竜,dragon,"_Vase_ . . . _eel_. In order not to confuse this kanji with the zodiacal _sign of the dragon_ , which we will meet later (Frame 2164) and use as a primitive, you might think here of a paper parade **dragon**.",
滝,waterfall,"_Water_ . . . _vase_ . . . _eels_. To avoid the confusion mentioned in the previous frame, the character learned there for _dragon_ should not be used as a primitive.",
豚,pork,Flesh . . . sow.,
逐,pursue,Sows . . . road.,
遂,consummate,The _horns_ atop the _sow_ suggest a boar at work in the background. Add the element for a _road_. Now create a story whose meaning is: **consummate**.,
家,house,"This is the full character whose primitive form we learned already. To help a little, this kanji recalls the times when the ""domestic"" animals were, as the word itself suggests, really kept in the **house**. Hence: _house_ . . . _sow_.",
嫁,marry into,"The kanji in this frame demonstrates the traditional Japanese approach to marriage: it is the _woman_ who leaves her family for another _house_ hold, thus **marrying into** a man's family.",

湯,hot water,Water . . . piggy bank.,
羊,sheep,"This pictograph shows the animal _horns_ at the top attached to the head (3rd stroke), the front and back legs (strokes 4 and 5) and body (final stroke).","* The primitive meaning of _sheep_ can add the further connotations given in the following frame. As we saw with the _cow_ , the ""tail"" is cut off when it is set immediately over another element: ⺷. Note the change in stroke order, as exemplified in the following frame."
美,beauty,Try to think of what the Chinese were on to when they associated the idea of **beauty** with a _large sheep_.,
洋,ocean,_Water_ . . . _sheep_. Be sure to keep the stories and key word of this kanji distinct from those for _sea_. (Frame 500).,
詳,detailed,Words/speaking . . . sheep.,
鮮,fresh,Fish . . . sheep.,
達,accomplished,"The key word is meant to connote someone ""skilled"" at something. On the _road_ we find _soil_ OVER _a sheep_. You may have to work with this one a while longer.",
羨,envious,"_Sheep_ . . . _water_ . . . _yawn/lack_. Although this character looks rather simple, special care should be taken in learning it because of the proximity of the final two elements to the character for _next_ , which we learned in frame 510. Note, too, that the _water_ comes UNDER the _sheep_ , rather than on its own to the left.",
差,distinction,Wool . . . craft.,

奮,stirred up,St. Bernard dog . . . turkey . . . rice field/brains.,
奪,rob,"Whereas _burglary_ (Frame 381) implies clandestine appropriation of another's property, **robbery** refers to taking by force. The primitive elements: _St. Bernard dog_ . . . _turkey_ . . . _glue_.",
確,assurance,"On the left you see the _rock_ , which is familiar enough. But pay attention to the right. Taking careful note of the unusual stroke order that has the ""chimney"" on the _house_ doubled up with the first stroke of the _turkey_ , we may see the right side as a _turkey house_ (or  "" _coop_ ""). We shall see this pattern only on one other occasion (Frame 2093), but even for these two characters it is well worth the trouble to single it out as a primitive.",
午,noon,"With a bit of stretching, you might see a horse's head pointing leftwards in this character. That gives the primary meaning of the Chinese zodiacal sign of the horse, which corresponds to the hour of **noon**. Note how this kanji primitive differs from that for _cow_ (Frame 260).","* As a primitive, this character gets the meaning of a _horse_. Any _horse_ image will do, except that of a _team of horses_ , which will come later (Frame 2132) and get its own primitive."
許,permit,Words . . . horse.,
歓,delight,"Again I cannot resist sharing my own associations. If you've ever seen Disney's animated interpretation of classical music, ""Fantasia,"" you will recall what was done there with Beethoven's ""Pastoral Symphony"" (the 6th), and the _flying horses_ that figured in it. The mares are bathing in the stream and the stallions begin to gather.

羽,feathers,"From the pictograph of two bird-wings, we get **feathers**.","* The related image of _wings_ can be added as a primitive meaning. It can also take the form  ョョ when used as a primitive, as we shall see in frames 618 and 619."

曰,sayeth,"_Pent in_ . . . _one_. The key word refers to famous sayings of famous people, and is the origin for the primitive meaning of _a tongue wagging in the mouth_ that we learned in frame 12. The size of this kanji, a relatively rare one, is what distinguishes it from _day_.",

園,park,Pent in . . . lidded crock . . . scarf.,
回,-times,"The suffix "" **-times** "" refers to a number of repetitions. Its elements: _a mouth_  . . . _pent in_. Hint: you may find it more helpful to forget the primitives and think of one circle revovling inside of another.",
壇,podium,"_Soil/ground_ . . . _top hat_ . . . _-times_ . . . _nightbreak_. With kanji as difficult as this one, it generally pays to toy with the various connotations of its primitives before settling on one image. Aim for as much simplicity as you can.",

心,heart,"This character, a pictographic representation of the **heart** , is among the most widely used primitives we shall meet.","* As a primitive, it can take three forms, to which we shall assign three distinct meanings. In its kanji-form, it appears BENEATH or to the RIGHT of its relative primitive and means th physical organ of the _heart_.   To the LEFT, it is abbreviated to three strokes, ⺖, and means a wildly emotional _state of mind_. And finally, at the very BOTTOM, it can take the form ⺗, in which case we give it the meaning of a _valentine_."

恩,grace,"Take **grace** in its sense of a favor freely bestowed, not in its meaning of charming manners or fluid movement. The primitives: _cause_ . . . _heart_.",
応,apply,"_Cave_ . . . _heart_. The sense of the key word here is of something appropriate that fills a particular need, and hence  "" **applies**. """,
意,idea,Sound . . . heart.,
臆,cowardice,Flesh . . . idea.,
想,concept,"To distinguish this kanji from that of the previous frame, focus on the sense of the ""con-"" in the word "" **concept**. "" Its elements are: _inter-_ . . . _heart_.",
息,breath,Nose . . . heart.,
憩,recess,"_Tongue_ . . . _nose_ . . . _heart_. The sense of _breath_ from the last frame should not be used, it could lead you to put only the _nose_ over the _heart_ and leave the _tongue_ off to one side.",

恐,fear,Craft . . . mediocre . . . heart.,

感,emotion,Mouths . . . marching . . . heart.,
憂,melancholy,"_Head_ . . . _crown_ . . . _heart_ . . . _walking legs_. Two things merit mention here. First, the doubling-up of the last stroke of _head_ with the top of the _crown_ serves to make the whole more aesthetically beautiful. It happens so rarely that the exceptions are easily learned. Second, try to make a single image out of the four elements. (Religious statuary of **melancholy** figures should offer plenty of suggestions.)",
寡,widow,"_House_ . . . _head_ . . . _dagger_. Immediately we get another instance of a very odd exception. Notice how the final stroke of the head is lengthened, giving the final two strokes a chance to stretch out and make room for the _dagger_ that fits in beneath.",

悦,ecstasy,State of mind . . . devil.,
恒,constancy,State of mind . . . span.,
悼,lament,"To keep this character distinct from others of similar connotation, one need only think of the Prophet Jeremiah whose poetry gave an _eminence_ to _the state of mind_ we call **lamentation**.",
悟,enlightenment,"I know of an Indian religious sect which teaches that **enlightenment** is to be had by covering the eyes with one's index fingers, the ears with the thumbs, and the mouth with the little fingers. While these differ a bit from the _five holes_ that we used to represent the  "" _I_ "" (frame 17), the idea of achieving a special _state of mind_ by covering those five places can help you learn this kanji. You might try the position out while you are learning this character.",

慎,humility,State of mind . . . truth.,
憾,remorse,"_State of mind_ . . . _emotion_. Hint: the etymology of  "" **remorse** "" indicates a memory that returns again and again to ""bite at"" one's conscience and disturb one's peace of mind.",

添,annexed,Water . . . heavens . . . valentine.,
必,invariably,"First note the stroke order of this character, which did not really evolve from the _heart_ , even though we take it that way. If one takes it as a pictograph ""dividing"" _the heart_ in half, then one has one of those **invariably** true bits of human anatomy: the fact that each _heart_ is divided into two halves.",
泌,ooze,_Water_ . . . the _invariably_ divided heart.,
手,hand,"Any way you count them, there are either too many or too few fingers to see a good pictograph of a **hand** in this character. But that it is, and so you must.",* Keep to the etymology when using this kanji as a primitive: a single _hand_ all by itself.
看,watch over,Hand . . . eyes.,
摩,chafe,Hemp . . . hand.,
我,ego,"_Hand_ . . . _fiesta_. Note how the second stroke of the _hand_ is stretched across to double up as the first stroke of the tasseled arrow we use for _fiesta_. Compare to frames 17, 36, and 564.",

議,deliberation,Words . . . righteousness.,

刑,punish,Two hands . . . saber.,
型,mould,"_Punish_ . . . _soil_. In cases like this, you might find it easier to break the character up into its more basic elements, like this: _two hands_ . . . _saber_ . . . _soil_.",
才,genius,"Whatever one is particularly adept at - one's special "" **genius** "" \- one can do very easily, ""with one finger"" as the phrase goes. This kanji is a pictograph of that one finger. Note how its distinctive form is created by writing the final stroke of the element for _fingers_ backwards.","* The primitive meaning, _genie_ , derives from the roots of the word _genius_. Use the _genie_ out in the open when the primitive appears to the right of or below its relative primitive, in that case it also keeps its same form. At the left, the form is altered, and the meaning becomes a _genie in the bottle_."
財,property,Clam . . . genie.,

乃,from,"This pictograph of a clenched fist is another of the ""hand primitives."" Take note of its rather peculiar drawing. Try to think of drawing a _fist_ (the primitive meaning)  "" **from** "" this character to give yourself a connotation for the otherwise abstract key word.",* The primitive meaning is taken from the pictograph: a _fist_.
携,portable,Fingers . . . turkey . . . fist.,
及,reach out,"The addition of a final stroke transforms this character from the primitive for a clenched _fist_ into the kanji for **reaching out** , much as a stroke of kindness can often turn anger into acceptance.","* As a primitive, this shall stand for _outstretched hands_. Only take care not to confuse it with that for _beg_ (Frame 501)"
吸,suck,_Mouth_ . . . _outstretched hands_. Hint: use the image of a nursing baby.,
扱,handle,Finger . . . outstretched hands.,
丈,length,"The **length** whose measure this kanji depicts extends from the tip of one hand to the tip of the other with _arms_ at full length. Notice the final stroke, which cuts across the vertical second stroke to distinguish it from _large_ (Frame 112).",
史,history,A mouth . . . tucked under the arm.,
吏,officer,One . . . mouth . . . tucked under the arm.,
更,grow late,The implication behind the meaning of **grow late** is that things are changing in the same way that the day turns into night. The elements: _ceiling_ . . . _sun_ . . . _tucked under the arm_.,
硬,stiff,Rocks . . . grow late.,
梗,spiny,"This character refers originally to a deciduous, rough tree that grows on mountain plains. From this it gets the secondary sense of rugged or **spiny**. Its primitive elements: _tree_ . . . _grow late_.",
又,or again,"Like the several abbreviations in Roman script to indicate ""and"" (+, &, etc.), this short two-stroke kanji is used for the similar meaning of **or again**.","* As a primitive, it will mean _crotch_ , as in the _crotch_ of the arm. Or whatever."
双,pair,The _crotch_ reduplicated gives us a **pair**.,
桑,mulberry,"_Crotches_ , _crotches_ everywhere . . . _tree_. Hint: think of a group of children playing an original version of  ""Here We Go 'Round the **Mulberry** Bush. """,

爪,claw,"This character is a pictograph of a bird's **claw** , and from there comes to mean animal **claws** in general (including human fingernails).","* As a primitive, we shall use the graphic image of a _vulture_ , a bird known for its powerful _claws_.

室,room,House . . . climax.,

棄,abandon,_Infant_ . . . _buckle_ (See frame 444) . . . _tree_.,

銃,gun,Metal . . . allot.,

崖,bluffs,Mountain . . . cliff . . . ivy.,
入,enter,"This character is meant to be a picture of someone walking leftwards, putting one leg forward in order to **enter** someplace. Since the  ""in"" side of a character is the left, it should be easy to remember the writing of this character.","* As a primitive, the meaning of the key word is expanded to include: _to go in_ , _to put in_ , _to come in_ , and the like. It generally appears atop its relative primitive, where, unlike the element for _umbrella_ , the two strokes do not touch each other, making it virtually the same as the kanji for _eight_.

谷,valley,"_Go in_ . . . _an umbrella_ . . . _a mouth_. Because of space restrictions, the element for _go in_ is shortened in this character. If you stand on your head and look at this kanji, the image of a **valley** stands out more clearly: the _mouth_ of the river whose water flows down at the intersection of the two mountains, with the final two strokes adding the element of perspective. Now get back on your feet again and see if the image still remains clear. If not, then return to the primitives and make a story in the usual way.",

容,contain,This character depicts a _house_ so large that it can **contain** an entire _valley_.,
溶,melt,Water . . . contain.,
欲,longing,_Valley_ . . . _yawn_. Be sure to keep the key word distinct from _pining_ (Frame 683).,
裕,abundant,"This character shows the typical _cloak_ of _valley_ folk, which, unlike the tailor-made, high-fashion overcoats of city folk, is loose-fitting and free- form. Hence the key word's meaning of **abundant**.",
鉛,lead (metal),Metal . . . gully.,
沿,run alongside,_Water_ . . . _gully_. The key word is meant to refer to things like rivers and railway tracks that **run alongside** something else.,

堂,hall,Outhouse . . . land.,
常,usual,Outhouse . . . towel.,
裳,skirt,The key word refers to an ancient **skirt** once used as part of a woman's costume. The primitives you have to work with are: _outhouse_ . . . _garment_.,
掌,manipulate,Outhouse . . . hand.,
皮,pelt,"The simplest way to remember this character is to see it as built up from that for _branch_. The first stroke can then stand for something  ""hanging"" down from the _branch_ , namely its bark or **pelt**. The barb at the end of the second stroke is the only other change. Merely by concentrating on this as you write the following small cluster of characters should be enough to fix the form in your mind. By way of exception, you might doodle around with the kanji's form to see what you can come up with.",

瞬,wink,Eye . . . birdhouse . . . sunglasses.,

撮,snapshot,"_Finger_ . . . _utmost_. This character _is_ used for taking photographs. Note how, conveniently, the element for  "" _take_ "" is included in it.",
恥,shame,"_Ear_ . . . _heart_. It is most rare to have the _heart_ at the right, rather than at the bottom. Take advantage of this fact when you compose your story.",

濁,voiced,"The key word for this kanji connotes the ""muddying"" effect on a soft consonant brought about by vibrating the vocal chords. For example, in English a ""j"" is **voiced** while a  ""sh"" is unvoiced. In Japanese, the し is changed to じ when it is **voiced**. The primitives are: _water_ . . . _eye_ . . . _bound up_ . . . _insect_.",
環,ring,"_Jewel_ . . . _eye_ . . . _ceiling_ . . . _mouth_ . . . _scarf_. The number of elements is large here, so take extra care. Learn it in conjunction with the next frame, since these are the only two cases in this book where the combination of elements to the right appears.",
還,send back,Road . . . eye . . . ceiling . . . mouth . . . scarf.,
夫,husband,"The kanji for _a_ **husband** or  ""head of the family"" is based on the kanji for _large_ and an extra line near the top for the  ""head."" Recall the kanji for _heavens_  already learned back in frame 457, and be sure to keep your story for this kanji different.",

失,lose,"To **lose**  here takes the sense of ""misplace,"" not the sense of _defeat_ , whose kanji we learned in frame 67. It pictures a _husband_ with something falling from his side as he is walking along, something he **loses**.","* As a primitive, this character can also mean to drop."
鉄,iron,Metal . . . to drop.,
迭,alternate,To drop . . . road.,
臣,retainer,"This kanji is actually a pictograph for an eye, distorted to make it appear that the pupil is protruding towards the right. This may not be an easy form to remember, but try this: Draw it once rather large, and notice how moving the two vertical lines on the right as far right as possible gives you the pictograph of the eye in its natural form. The ""pop-eye"" image belongs to an Emperor's **retainer** standing in awe before his ruler.","* As a primitive, the meaning of the key word becomes _slave_."

行,going,"By joining the top four strokes, you should get a picture of the front current of a river, the stream trailing behind. Hence the character for **going**.","* As a primitive, this character has two forms. Reduced to the left side only, it can mean a _column_ , _going_ , or a _line_ of something or other.

米,rice,This kanji has a pictographic resemblance to a number of grains of **rice** lying on a plate in the shape of a star.,"* As a primitive, it keeps its meaning of _rice_ , and is meant to connote a very ordinary, commonplace grain, in contrast to the primitive for _wheat_ that we just learned. (This meaning accords well with Japan, where the output of _rice_ far exceeds that of _wheat_.) It occasionally takes a different shape when it stands on its own, or is joined to a line above. In this case, we shall have it refer specifically to _grains of rice_. This primitive is not to be confused with the similar-looking primitive for _water_. While the stroke orders are nearly alike, _grains of rice_ has 5 strokes, while _water_ only has 4 because it joins the second and third strokes into one. Finally, we may note that by itself the kanji for _rice_ is an abbreviation used for the _United States_ , which can then also serve as an alternate reading for the main primitive form, if you so wish."

Note that the final vertical stroke in the element for _sheep_ is extended to form the first stroke for _grains of rice_.,
求,request,"Let the _drop_ in the upper right-hand corner of this character close the right angle off to make an _arrowhead_. Whenever we find the _needle_ with that _drop_ in an element that has no other special meaning, we will take advantage of this primitive meaning.

Two such **bamboo** stalks are pictured here.","* As a primitive, the meaning remains the same, but the vertical lines are severely abbreviated so that they can take their place at the top where, like _flowers_ , they are always to be found."

It is made up of five primitive elements: _vase_ . . . _flesh_ . . . _slingshot_ . . . _fishhook_ (enclosure) . . . _three_.",
人,person,"The character for _enter_ (Frame 842) showed someone walking inwards (in terms of the direction of writing), the one for **person** , shown here, represents someone walking outwards.","* As a primitive, it can keep its kanji form except when it appears to the left (its normal position), where it is made to stand up in the form ⺅ (Similar to イ). The primitive meaning is another matter. The abstract notion of _person_ so often has a relation to the meaning of the kanji that confusion readily sets in. So many of the previous stories have included people in them that simply to use _person_ for a primitive meaning would be risky. We need to be more specific, to focus on one particular _person_. Try to choose someone who has not figured in the stories so far, perhaps a colorful member of the family or a friend whom you have known for a long time. That individual will appear again and again, so be sure to choose someone who excites your imagination."

Something placed atop the altar is put on **show** for all to see.","* As a primitive, this kanji means _altar_. At the left, the abbreviated form that this element takes is made by chopping the _altar_ in half and leaving only one dot behind to represent the right side. The new appearance of this primitive form, ネ, should be kept distinct from that for _cloak_ , identical except for the one final short stroke."

由,wherefore,"The "" **wherefore** "" of this kanji explains the reason or origin of a thing. It does this graphically by depicting a seed in a _rice field_ sending up a single sprout, which is the whole why and **wherefore** of the seed's falling in the earth and dying. (When the _flower_ appears, you will recall from frame 249, we have a full _seedling_.)","* As a primitive, in conformity to the explanation above, this kanji will be taken to mean _shoot_ or _sprout_."

岬,headland,"Like the _cape_ (Frame 164) and the _promontory_ (Frame 840), the **headland** refers to a jut of land. Its elements: _mountain_ . . . _roots_.",
挿,insert,"_Fingers_ . . . _thousand_ . . . _roots_. Observe how the writing order does not follow the elements in order, because the final stroke is used for two different elements.",
申,speaketh,"The olde English is used here to indicate a humble form of the third person singular of the verb ""to speak."" It is written by a _tongue wagging in the mouth_ with a _walking stick_ rammed through it and coming out at both ends.","* While this kanji has obvious affinities to the ""seed"" group, it also happens to be the zodiacal sign of the _monkey_ (the one who _speaketh_ no evil, among other things). We shall therefore take _monkey_ as its primitive meaning."

果,fruit,"The final stage of the seed is reached when the plant has reached its full growth (the _tree_ ) and comes to fruition, producing **fruit** full of new seeds that can return to the earth and start the process all over again. The main thing to notice here is the element for _brains_ at the top, which might prove more helpful than _rice field_ for creating an image. The writing, however, follows the order of a _sun_ with a _tree_ whose trunk runs through the _sun_.",

画,brush-stroke,"In forming an image for the key word, it is helpful to know that this kanji is used for artistic representations (like a completed painting), and as a counter for the number of **brush-strokes** in a character (as, for instance, in Indexes II and III at the end of this book). Its elements are: _ceiling_ . . . _sprout_ . . . _shovel_.",
歯,tooth,Footprint . . . rice . . . shovel.,
曲,bend,"Picture yourself grabbing hold of the two strokes poking out the top of the kanji and wrenching them apart, thus giving the sense of **bend**. If you think of them as deriving from the element for _brains_ beneath (of course, the middle stroke has been reduplicated and pulled out to where it can be grabbed hold of), you can associate the key word with **bending** someone's mind to your own point of view.",

斗,Big Dipper,"The **Big Dipper** here is of course the constellation of Ursa Major, of which this kanji is a sort of pictographic representation.","* Since we already have a primitive element for a ""dipper"" \- namely, the _ladle_ \- we shall let this one stand for a _measuring cup_. By the way, it would make a rather large one, since the kanji is also used for a measure of about 18 liters!"

科,department,"Think here of the faculty or **department** you entered in university, using the elements: _measuring cup_ . . . _wheat_.",
図,map,"_Pent in_ . . . _Big Dipper_. Hint: among the songs dating from the days of slavery that have become part of American folklore is one called  ""Follow the Drinking Gourd."" It referred to the nighttime travel of runaway slaves (those _pent in_ ) who had no **maps** other than the stars to guide them, among them the bright and predominant _Big Dipper_ , the ""Drinking Gourd.""",
用,utilize,_Meat_ . . . _walking stick_. Be sure to keep this key word distinct from that for _use_ (Frame 1065). The stroke order is exactly as you would expect it from the order of the primitive elements as given.,"* As a primitive element, we shall substitute the image of a _screwdriver_ , perhaps the most _utilized_ of all tools around the house."

錯,confused,Metal . . . once upon a time.,
借,borrow,Person . . . once upon a time.,

措,set aside,Fingers . . . once upon a time.,
散,scatter,Salad . . . flesh . . taskmaster.,
廿,twenty,"The two _tens_ joined at the bottom by a short line is actually the old character for **twenty** , which we might as well learn since we need its primitive form. It is written the same as _salad_ , except for the shorter final stroke.",
庶,commoner,Caverns . . . oven fire.,
遮,intercept,Commoner . . . road.,

噴,erupt,Mouth . . . haystack . . . clams.,
墳,tomb,"_Soil_ . . . _haystack_ . . . _clams_. In order not to confuse this kanji with that for a _grave_ (Frame 246), something like the image of an Egyptian **tomb** should be adopted, with all its special connotations.",
憤,aroused,State of mind . . . haystack . . . clams.,
焼,bake,_Hearth_ . . . _straw man_. Take care to distinguish this kanji from _cook_ (Frame 507) and _burn_ (Frame 549) when you compose your story.,
暁,daybreak,Sun . . . straw man.,
半,half,"Although the writing order is different, one can remember the appearance of this character by seeing it as a _little needle_ \- the kind used for splitting hairs in **half**. (Again, according to rule, _little_ takes a stroke beneath it in order to be placed over an element that has no horizontal line at the top.)",
伴,consort,Person . . . half.,
畔,paddy ridge,_Rice field_ . . . _half_. The key word here refers to the **ridges** that rise up between the sections of a rice **paddy**.,
判,judgment,"_Half_ . . . _saber_. You might recall the famous **judgment** of King Solomon, who offered to slice a baby in two with a _saber_ to give _half_ to each of the mothers who claimed it as her own.",
拳,fist,_Quarter_ . . . _hand_. Be careful to keep this key word distinct from the primitive element of the same meaning we met back in Frame 741.,
券,ticket,Quarter . . . dagger.,
巻,scroll,"_Quarter_ . . . _snake_. The key word refers to a manuscript rolled up into a **scroll** , not to a _hanging scroll_ (Frame 435).",

謄,facsimilie,Moon . . . quarter . . . words.,
片,one-sided,"This kanji is based on the pictograph of a tree with some branches going upwards and others hanging down, split right down the middle. When that picture's right side is isolated, it becomes the kanji for **one-sided** , in the sense of only one part of a whole.",
版,printing block,"Although this character also carries the sense of an ""edition"" of a publication, the elements, _one-sided_ and _anti-_ , more readily suggest its other meaning of a **printing block**.",
之,of,"This character is now used chiefly in proper names, and is best learned as the character closest to the hiragana え, though in fact it has no relation to it.","* In order to give this kanji a more concrete meaning when it is used as a primitive element, think of it as referring to _building blocks_ with the hiragana written on them, much the same as the A-B-C blocks you played with as a child."
乏,destitution,Drop of . . . building blocks.,
芝,turf,Flowers . . . building blocks.,
不,negative,"You may play with the primitives of this kanji as you wish ( _ceiling_ . . . _person_ . . . _a drop of_ ), _but_ you will probably find that its simplicity, and its frequency, make it easy to remember just as it is.",
否,negate,Negative . . . mouth.,
杯,cupfuls,Tree . . . negative.,
矢,dart,"When shot high into the _heavens_ , the **dart** gets so small it looks like a mere _drop_. Although this character could as well mean  ""arrow,"" it has no connection with the primitive of that meaning. Hence the new key word.",
矯,rectify,"_Dart_ . . . _angel_. Compare your stories for _correct_ (Frame 405), _revise_ (Frame 362), and _reformation_ (Frame 567).",

帰,homecoming,"_Spear_ . . . _broom_ . . . _apron_. The character for _lady_ (Frame 1234) shares the same right side as this character, which does not bode for a very happy **homecoming**.",
弓,bow,"This character pictures the bent wooden **bow**. Later we will learn how to make the _bowstring_ that goes with it (Frame 1490). If you stretch this character out and see the indentation on the left as its handle, the pictography should be clearer.",

与,bestow,"_Slingshot_ . . . _one_. Later we shall learn the character for _give_ (Frame 2046), but even so, it is a good idea already at this point to distinguish this key word from _impart_ (Frame 795) and _grant_ (Frame 1131).",
写,copy,Crown . . . bestow.,
身,somebody,"The key word **somebody** was chosen to convey the double meaning of this kanji: body and person. Its composition is based on the _nose_ (which, you will recall, is also the kanji for _oneself_ ). The extension of the bottom and far right strokes of that element, together with the unusual diagonal stroke, forms the pictograph of **somebody** with a prominent paunch.",
射,shoot,"I **shot** an arrow into the air, And it landed I know not where  goes the poem. (The poor poet obviously loses a lot of arrows.) This kanji, however, tells us where it did land. Its elements: _somebody_ . . . _glued to_.",
謝,apologize,Words . . . shoot.,
老,old man,"First, do not confuse this character with _venerable old man_ (Frame 849), which is far more rarely used. The character for an **old man** begins with an abbreviation of the character for _somebody_ , the _nose_ having been shortened into a simple crisscross of lines. But there is another, simpler way to remember it all: the _soil_ drawn first indicates that one has come close to the age when  ""dust to dust"" begins to take on a personal meaning, the diagonal _walking stick_ for getting around, and the _spoon_ for being spoon- fed.","* As a primitive, the meaning is the same, but the final two strokes are omitted so that they can be replaced with other elements."
考,consider,"_Old man_ . . . _slingshot_. Remember: you already have kanji for _discriminating_ (Frame 521), _deliberation_ (Frame 692), and _think_ (Frame 651).",

教,teach,Filial piety . . . taskmaster.,
拷,torture,Fingers . . . consider.,
者,someone,"_Old man_ . . . _sun_. This key word looks to be difficult because of its proximity to _somebody_. In fact, it is a very common kanji that will cause you no difficulty at all. Its meaning should be seen as the human referent for the abstract noun  ""something.""",* As a primitive it means a _puppet_ -on-a-string.

管,pipe,Bamboo . . . bureaucrat.,
父,father,The kindness and hard work of the ideal **father** is seen in this abbreviation of the _taskmaster_ that leaves off his rod or whip (the first stroke) and replaces it with the sweat of the **father's** brow (the two _drops_ at the top).,
釜,cauldron,_Father_ . . . _metal_. Note the stroke overlap between _father_ and _metal_.,

足,leg,_Mouth_ . . . _mending_. Note that the last stroke of _mouth_ and the first of _mending_ overlap.,"* As a primitive on the left, it is amended to something similar to _correct_ in place of _mending_. Its meaning remains _leg_ , but should be thought of as a _wooden leg_ in order to avoid confusion with other similar elements, namely _human legs_ , _animal legs_ , and _walking legs_."

踪,trail,_Wooden leg_ . . . _religion_. The key word refers to a **trail** of footprints or tracks left behind.,
骨,skeleton,"This kanji and primitive refers to the _part of the body_ composed of the bones and their joints. The top part of the kanji, terminating in the element for _crown_ , is a pictograph of a bone joint. I leave it to you to put the pieces together, so to speak.",

陪,auxiliary,Pinnacle . . . muzzle.,
陽,sunshine,"Different from the primitive for _sun_ (which figures in the character) and the kanji for _ray_ (Frame 125), the key word **sunshine** is meant to convey the meaning of the masculine principle in nature, or  ""Yang."" (The dark is viewed mythically as the feminine principle, see frame 1718.) From there it comes to mean _sun_ also. The elements are: _pinnacle_ . . . _piggy bank_.",

Note, however, that in its primitive form the _legs_ are straightened out and reach down to the bottom of the _mouth_. Hence, we get the shape ⻃.

The **gates** usually serve as an enclosure, and are written BEFORE whatever it is they enclose.","* As a primitive, we shall continue to give it the meaning of _gates_ , but recommend the image of swinging doors (like the kind once common at entrances to saloons) to distinguish it from the primitive for _door_."

欄,column,Tree . . . gates . . . east.,
闘,fight,_Gates_ . . . _table_ . . . _glue_. Do not confuse with _contend_ (Frame 1238).,
倉,godown,"The single _gate_ is used here not in order to represent one _gate_ , but many of them, indeed a _meeting of gates_. Add _mouth_ (as an entrance here) and you end up with **godown**. That should help keep this character distinct from _warehouse_ (Frame 633).",
創,genesis,Godown . . . saber.,
非,un-,"This key word, a negating prefix, is a doodle of a heavy iron pole with bars extending in both directions, to create the picture of a jail cell. From there to "" **un-** "" is but a short step.","* As a primitive, we shall draw on the explanation above for the meaning of _jail cell_."
俳,haiku,"This character is used for the **haiku** , the 17-syllable poem that is one of Japan's best-known literary forms. Its elements: _person_ .. . _jail cell_.",

韓,Korea,"As with _Italy_ (Frame 1245) and _Africa_ (Frame 1391), this character simply abbreviates the full name of _Korea_. Its elements: _mist_ . . . _locket_.",
干,dry,It is best to see this kanji as a pictograph of a revolving circular clothesline (viewed from the side). Spin it around quickly in your mind's eye to give it the connotation of to **dry**.,* The primitive meaning is _clothesline_.

岸,beach,Mountain . . . cliff . . . dry.,
幹,tree trunk,"_Mist_ . . . _umbrella_ . . . _dry_. The meaning of this key word extends beyond **tree trunks** to represent the main stem or line of anything from railway lines to managerial staffs. This should help distinguish it from the stories used earlier for _book_ (Frame 224) and _body_ (Frame 1030), both of which made use of the image of a **tree trunk** , as well as the kanji for _trunk_ (Frame 194).",
芋,potato,Flowers . . . potato.,
宇,eaves,House . . . potato.,
余,too much,_Umbrella_ . . . _potato_ . . . _little_. The last stroke of _potato_ and the first of _little_ coincide in this character.,"* Since the phrase "" _too much_ "" is overly abstract, we shall take the image of a _scale_ whose indicator spins round and round on the dial because _too much_ weight has been set on it. It will help to use this image in learning the kanji itself."
除,exclude,Pinnacle . . . scale.,
徐,gradually,Line . . . scale.,

頼,trust,Bundle . . . head.,
瀬,rapids,Water . . . bundle . . . head.,
勅,imperial order,"In order to keep this character distinct from that for an _imperial edict_ (Frame 366), we must draw again on a pun. Think of the **order** here as a mail **order** or an **order** of pizza phoned in by the Emperor for delivery to the **imperial** palace. Then it will not be hard to put together _bundle_ and _muscle_ to form a story about an **imperial order**.",
疎,alienate,_Zoo_ . . . _bundle_. Note that the element for _zoo_ is flattened out on the left just as _leg_ (Frame 1372) had been. This is the only time we will meet this form in this book.,

粛,solemn,"_Rake_ . . . _rice_ . . . _fenceposts_. Take special care to draw this character in the same order as the primitive. Note too, that the fourth stroke for _rice_ is already taken care of by the fourth stroke of _rake_.",

甘,sweet,"This kanji is a pictograph of a small wicker basket. (The extra short stroke in the middle helps keep it distinct from the character for _twenty_.) All one needs to add is some image of **sweet** cakes or breads carried in the basket, and the union of picture and meaning is complete. Take care not to confuse with _confectionary_ (Frame 1203).","* As a primitive, the pictograph's meaning of a _wicker basket_ is used, a small one like the kind used for picnics."

基,fundamentals,Bushel basket . . . soil.,
甚,tremendously,"_Bushel basket_ . . . _equal_. Note how the first stroke of _equal_ doubles up with the sixth stroke of the _bushel basket_ , and how the _animal legs_ of the _bushel basket_ are dropped to make room for the _human legs_ of _equal_.",

貴,precious,Purse . . . shells.,
遺,bequeath,Precious . . . road.,
遣,dispatch,"This kanji takes away the _maestro_ 's baton and replaces it with a _purse_. The _road_ represents his being **dispatched** on his way a san obvious misfit. You will remember that when he did have his baton, he was being _chased_ down the road by his fans. All of which shows what a difference a single stroke can make!",
潰,defile,Water . . . precious.,
舞,dance,"The top two strokes show someone _reclining_ , and the next six are a pictograph of an oaken _tub_ ribbed with metal strips, like the kind once used for bathing. At the bottom, the _sunglasses_ round off the character.",
無,nothingness,"This character is the Japanese character for the supreme philosophical principle of much Oriental thought: **nothingness**. Make use of the oaken _tub_ from the previous frame, and add to that the _oven fire_ at the bottom.",

阻,thwart,Pinnacle . . . shelf.,
査,investigate,Tree . . . shelf.,
助,help,"_Shelf_ . . . _power_. The reason why the _shelf_ appears on the left here is that the right side is the normal position for power, the stronger primitive. Indeed, the only exception in all the kanji is the character for _add_ (Frame 932).",
宜,best regards,"This kanji, a polite way of expressing one's **best regards** to another. Its elements: _house_ . . . _shelf_.",
畳,tatami mat,Rice field . . . crown . . . shelf.,
並,row,"This character represents a slightly stylized duplication of the kanji for _stand up_. By lengthening the sixth and seventh strokes, you will see how this is done.","* The primitive meaning remains the same as that of the kanji, but special attention has to be given to the varieties of shape this element can undergo. It is the most difficult one you will meet in this book. When it appears BENEATH its relative primitive, the top three strokes are omitted, though the third horizontal stroke may be doubled up with the bottom horizontal stroke of the element above it. ATOP its relative primitive, it can keep its kanji shape. When it does not, the top three strokes are removed and all of them are replaced BELOW the primitive's bottom line.

僕,me,"This key word is yet another synonym for ""I,"" somewhat more familiar in tone. As a rule, it is a word that boys and men use to refer to themselves. Its elements: _person_ . . . _husbands_ . . . _in a row upside down_.",
共,together,_Salad_ . . . _animal legs_.,"* The primitive retains the meaning of _together_. Imagine things _strung together_ like fish on a line, beads on a thread, or whatever. The main thing is to avoid putting them in a straight row, which would confound this element with the previous one. As we saw with _bushel basket_ , this primitive can join its legs to the final horizontal stroke and stretch them to form an enclosure."

井,well,"Recalling that there are no circular strokes, and that the shape of the square and the square within a square (Frame 630) have already been used, it should be relatively easy to see how this character can be consider a pictograph of a **well**.",
丼,donburi,"_Donburi_ is a bowl of rice with eel or meat on it. The character is a pictograph, perhaps designed by someone who felt that the portion of meat he was served with his bowl of rice looked to be no more than a tiny _drop_ in the _well_.",

耕,till,Christmas tree . . . well.,
亜,Asia,"In this kanji, the abbreviation for **Asia** , you should be able to see the character for _mouth_ behind the Roman numeral II.",
悪,bad,Asia . . . heart.,
円,circle,"This kanji, also used for Yen, is one you are not likely to need to study formally, since you can hardly get around in Japan without it. The connection is that the yennies, like pennies, are **circular** in shape. In any case, the elements are: _glass canopy_ . . . _walking stick_ . . . _one_.",
角,angle,"_Bound up_ . . . _glass canopy_ . . . _walking stick_ . . . _two_. If you write the character once, you will see why we avoided using the element for _soil_ , which would prompt you to write it in improper order.","* As a primitive, imagine the tool used by draftsmen and carpenters to draw right- _angles_."

冊,tome,This key word is a counter for books. It differs from _scrapbook_ both in the writing order and in the extension of the second horizontal stroke.,
柵,palisade,Tree . . . tome.,
典,code,"We introduce this character here because of its connection to the book-related kanji treated above. It is based on the character for _bend_ (frame 1256), whose last stroke is lengthened to coincide with the first stroke of the element for _tool_.",

逓,parcel post,Drag . . . cornstalk . . . belt . . . road.,
段,grade,"The kanji connoting rank or class shows us a new element on the left: the familiar primitive for _staples_ with an additional stroke cutting through the vertical stroke. It is easiest in these cases to make a primitive related to what we already know. Hence, we call it a _staple gun_. To the right, _missile_.",

詞,parts of speech,"The key word, **parts of speech** , refers to nouns, verbs, adjective, adverbs, and so on. The elements: _words_ . . . _directors_.",
飼,domesticate,_Eat_ . . . _director_. The sense is of rearing of animals.,
嗣,heir,Mouth . . . scrapbook . . . director.,
舟,boat,"After the _drop_ and the _glass canopy_ , we come to a combination of three strokes that we met only once before, in the character for _mama_ (frame 105). The pictographic meaning we gave it there has no etymological relationship to this character, but use it if it helps.",
舶,liner,The type of _boat_ connoted by this key word is a large oceangoing **liner**. The important thing here is to work with the elements _boat_ and _dove_ to make an image distinct from that of the former frame. Don't count on size alone to distinguish the _boat_ from the **liner**.,

弧,arc,Bow . . . melon.,
孤,orphan,Child . . . melon.,
繭,cocoon,"Though it's a good thing that the primitive for **cocoon** has been radically abbreviated from this, its full form as a kanji, the story it holds is a charming one. The silkworm ( _insect_ ) eats the leaves of the mulberry bush (the _flowers_ ), digests them and transforms them into _thread_ with which it spins about itself, in mystic wisdom, its own coffin (the _hood_ ). The dividing line that separates the two elements helps the picture of the little worm cutting itself off from contact with the outside world, but as a character stroke, it is a clear exception.",
益,benefit,Poised over the _dish_ here is a pair of _animal horns_ that are attached to a pair of _animal legs_ by a single horizontal stroke.,
暇,spare time,"The element for _day_ on the left is logical enough. Next to it we see _staples_ being held in _mouth_ (one stroke is doubled up), indicating working in one's hobby or handicrafts at home on one's **spare time**. The small _box_ at the top right is facing backwards, or more properly  ""inside out."" Finally, we have the _crotch_ at the bottom.",
敷,spread,"At the top we have the _arrowhead_ whose vertical line joins it to the _rice field_ (or _brains_ ) below it. Beneath it, the _compass_ , and to the right, the _taskmaster_.",
来,come,This odd but common kanji is built up of the character for _not yet_ into which a pair of _animal horns_ has been inserted.,
気,spirit,The **spirit** in this character refers to the changeable moods and airs of one's personality as well as to the more essential combination of vital forces that distinguish things and individuals one from the other. Its elements are: _reclining_ . . . _floor_ . . . _fishhook_ . . . _sheaf_. Do not confuse with _spirits_ (Frame 1930).,
汽,vapor,Think of this character as a sibling of that for _spirit_. Simply replace _sheaves_ with drops of _water_ on the left in order to get _vapor_.,
飛,fly,"The two _large hooks_ have little propellers (the two _drops_ on each _hook_ ) attached to them for **flying**. Beneath is the _measuring box_ , which serves as the body of this **flying** contraption. The stroke order will cause some problems, so take care with it.",
沈,sink,"The technique for **sinking** used in this kanji is unique. Rather than the biblical image of tying a millstone about the victim's neck, here we see a _crown_ tied about one _leg_ before the unfortunate party is tossed into the _water_.",
枕,pillow,Tree . . . crown tied around leg of person.,
妻,wife,Ten . . . rakes . . . woman.,
凄,nifty,Ice . . . wife.,
衰,decline,"Let this key word connote the **decline** and fall of the Roman Empire. It shows a fellow in a _top hat_ and _scarf_ , trying hard to look happy by putting a _walking stick_ in his _mouth_ sideways to twist his face into a grotesque but semi permanent smile.",
衷,inmost,"Between the _top hat_ and the _scarf_ you will see the character for _in_ which is truncated at the bottom so as not to interfere with the _scarf_. You can think of this character forming as a pair with that of the former frame: there the _in_ (the _walking stick_ in the _mouth_ ) was set on its side, here it is set upright.",
面,mask,"Imagine a **mask** over your head with _eyes_ peeping out from all over the head, a _hundred_ in all (the element for _eye_ displacing the fifth stroke of that for _hundred_ ).",
麺,noodles,Barley . . . mask.,
革,leather,"After the _flowers_ at the top (painted on the **leather** for decoration), we see the element for _car_ with the middle stroke left out. Think of the seats having been taken out so that they can be reupholstered with this decorated **leather**.",
靴,shoes,Leather . . . change.,
覇,hegemony,Old West . . . leather . . . moon.,
声,voice,"The _samurai_ at the top is familiar enough. The combination beneath, which looks like a _flag_ with a line running through it, is not. Try to devise some way to take note of it, and pay attention to the writing.",
眉,eyebrow,The _flag_ here has an extra vertical stroke in it. Think of it as an **eyebrow** pencil stuck in the _eye_.,
呉,give,"The complex of strokes in this kanji is unusual and difficult, because of the fourth stroke, which is rare (see frames 33 and 34). The _mouth_ and _tool_ are already familiar.",
娯,recreation,Woman . . . give.,
誤,mistake,Words . . . give.,
蒸,steam,"The _flower_ at the top and the _floor_ with the _oven fire_ beneath are familiar. The problem is what comes in between. It is formed by the character for _complete_ , whose vertical stroke doubles up as the first stroke of _water_.",
承,acquiesce,"The sense of passive acceptance or reception of information is contained in this key word. The form is based on the middle portion of the preceding character, with three additional strokes, best thought of as the kanji for _three_.",
函,bin,"This is the character from which the element for _shovel_ derives. Within it comes the element for _snare_ , with the _sparkler_ surrounding it.",
極,poles,The **poles** this key word refers to are the extremities of the earth or the terminals of an electric field. The elements are: _tree_ . . . _snare_ . . . _mouth_ . . . _crotch_ . . . _floor_.,
牙,tusk,"If you play with this primitive's form with pencil and paper, you will see that it begins with a _box_ -like shape, and ends with the final two strokes of the _halberd_ , a convenient combination for the **tusk** protruding from the mouth of an animal.","* Since this kanji has 4 strokes, you would expect that as a primitive it would also have 4 - but in fact it has 5 in the following two frames (the second stroke between divided into 2 strokes) and reverts to 4 again in frame 2056."
芽,bud,Flowers . . . tusk.,
邪,wicked,Tusk . . . city walls.,
雅,gracious,Tusk . . . an old turkey.,
釈,interpretation,Animal tracks . . . shakuhachi.,
番,turn,"This key word has been chosen for its overlay of several meanings similar to those of the kanji: a **turn** of duty, a round, a number, and so forth. Its composite elements: _animal tracks_ . . . _rice field_.","* As a primitive element, we choose the image of a pair of _dice_ which it is your _turn_ to throw."
審,hearing,The **hearing** referred to in this character relates to trials in the courts. The elements: _house_ . . . _dice_.,
翻,flip,Dice . . . feathers.,
藩,clan,Flowers . . . water . . . dice.,
毛,fur,"This character simply reverses the direction of the final stroke of _hand_ to produce **fur**. If you reverse your _hand_ and put its palm down, you will have the side on which **fur** grows.",
耗,decrease,Christmas tree . . . fur.,
尾,tail,Flag . . . fur.,
宅,home,House . . . lock of hair.,
託,consign,Words . . . lock of hair.,
為,do,"This character rightly belongs to the previous lesson, but we held it until now because of the final element, the _tail feathers_. After the _drop_ at the outset, the next three strokes are completely novel and should be given special attention.",
偽,falsehood,Person . . . do.,
畏,apprehensive,Field . . . hairpin.,
長,long,"In line with the story of the preceding frame, the _hair_ that needs the _hairpin_ is **long**.","* The primitive of this kanji has two more shapes in addition to that of the kanji itself. Above its relative primitive, it is abbreviated form will mean _hair_. Further abbreviated, it will mean the long, mangy _mane_ of an animal."
張,lengthen,Bow . . . long.,
帳,notebook,Towel . . . long.,
脹,dilate,Flesh . . . long.,

喪,miss,"_Soil_ . . . two _mouths_ . . . _hairpin_. Hint: see _spit_ (Frame 162). The key word carries the wide range of meanings readily associated with it: error, loss, absence, and so on.",

悩,trouble,State of mind . . . owl . . . villain.,
厳,stern,Owl . . . cliff . . . daring.,
鎖,chain,_Metal_ . . . _little_ . . . _shells_. We have saved this character until no win order to draw attention to the visual difference between the _owl_ and _little_. By now your eyes should be so accustomed to these apparently infinitesimal differences that the point is obvious.,
挙,raise,Owl . . . tool . . . hand.,
誉,reputation,Owl . . . tool . . . saying.,
猟,game hunting,Pack of wild dogs . . . owl . . . wind . . . cornstalk.,
鳥,bird,"_Dove_ . . . _one_ . . . _tail feathers_. This is, of course, the character from which we derived the primitive meaning of _dove_. Note the lengthening of the second stroke.",
鳴,chirp,Mouth . . . bird.,
鶴,crane,"_Turkey house_ . . . _bird_. The first element appears on only one other occasion, back in frame 609.",
烏,crow,"The only thing that distinguishes this character from that for _bird_ is the omission of the one stroke that makes it _white_. Which is logical enough, when you consider that there are no **crows** of that color.",
蔦,vine,Flower . . . bird.,
鳩,pigeon,Baseball . . . bird.,
鶏,chicken,Vulture . . . husband . . . bird.,
島,island,"The _bird's tail_ is tucked under here, because it has come to stop on a _mountain_ to rest from its journey across the waters. Thus the kanji comes to mean an **island**.",
暖,warmth,"Unlike the character for _warm_ weather learned earlier (Frame 1560), this kanji and its key word can also refer to the **warmth** of human congeniality. Its elements are: _sun_ . . . _migrating ducks_.",
媛,beautiful woman,Woman . . . migrating ducks.,
援,abet,Fingers . . . migrating ducks.,

嘱,entrust,Mouth . . . belong.,
偶,accidentally,"The _person_ on the left is familiar. As for the right side, we may combine the _insect_ with a _brain_ (observe the writing) and a _belt_ to create the _Talking Cricket_ who served as Pinocchio's conscience. ( _The belt_ is there because he pulls it off to give unrepentant little Pinocchio a bit of  ""strap"" now and again.)",

隅,corner,Pinnacle . . . Talking Cricket.,

塑,model,This kanji depicts the art of **modeling** clay or wood into a figure of your choice. The elements for composing it are: _mountain goat_ . . . _moon_ . . . _soil_.,
遡,go upstream,Mountain goat . . . moon . . . road.,
岡,Mount,"Here we see a _mountain goat_ "" **mounted** "" under a _glass canopy_. In this and the following frames, think of a particular **Mount** you know.",

揺,swing,Fingers . . . condor.,
謡,Noh chanting,Words . . . condor.,
鬱,gloom,"Learning this character will take a little doing. Before we start, it is a good idea to keep the key word distinct from _melancholy_ (Frame 663), with which it combines to create the psychological condition of depression (a metaphor based on the hollow or sinking of the material _depression_ we met in Frame 1421). The picture of **gloom** begins with a small _grove_ of trees, under which we see a _crown_ made out of used _tin cans_. Next (the lower half of the kanji) we find a combination that appears only a few times in modern characters and only once in those treated in the volumes of _Remembering the Kanji_. It is composed of a _shovel_ with a _sheaf_ dotted with small _drops_ on all sides. Think of it as a large scoop _shovel_ attached to the front of a bulldozer, whose driver is singing: ♪  ""Bulldozing in the _sheaves_ , bulldozing in the _sheaves_... "" ♪ The _drops_ represent the chaff flying about as the _sheaves_ are tossed about by the heavy machinery. There is _someone sitting on the ground_ alongside, watching as the machinery makes its way around the neighboring farmland - and it's you, wearing your _tin-can crown_. You feel overwhelmed by the impending doom as the invasion of agro- business draws closer and closer to the _grove_ , the only patch of woods that remains of what once was a vast forest. The whole scene represents a re- _shaping_ of the natural environment that brings the heavy weight of **gloom** down upon you. A bit much, perhaps, but there are enough elements to allow for any number of other combinations.",
就,concerning,_Capital_ . . . _chihuahua_ with a _human leg_ in place of one of its paws.,
蹴,kick,Wooden leg . . . concerning.,
懇,sociable,Skunk . . . silver . . . heart.,

貌,countenance,Skunk . . . white . . . human legs.,
免,excuse,"This character is used for **excusing** oneself for a failure of courtesy. The elements are: _bound up_ . . . _sun_ (oddly enough, laid on its side) . . . _human legs_.","* For the primitive meaning, we shall refer to this character as a _rabbit_ , for which the old form of the character is 兔."
逸,elude,Rabbit . . . road.,
晩,nightfall,Sun . . . rabbit.,
勉,exertion,_Rabbit_ . . . _muscle_. Notice how the last stroke of _rabbit_ is stretched out to underlie the element for _muscle_.,
象,elephant,"A _rabbit_ 's head with the body of a _sow_ represents an **elephant**. Little wonder that the kanji also means  ""phenomenon""!",
像,statue,Person . . . elephant.,
馬,horse,"Let the extra vertical stroke in the _mane_ combine with the first vertical stroke to give an image of the **horse's** long neck. The only odd thing is the _tail feathers_ at the end, but that should present a good image to remember the character by. The fact that the last stroke of _mane_ and the first of _tail feathers_ coincide should no longer surprise you.","* As a primitive, this kanji will mean a _team of horses_ as distinct from the single _horse_ whose primitive we met earlier."
駒,pony,"_Team of horses_ . . . _phrase_. In American slang, a **pony** is an underground translation of a classical text, which students who cannot manage the difficult _phrases_ of the original language consult and pass on from one generation to the next.",

罵,insult,Eyeball . . . team of horses.,
騰,inflation,Meat . . . quarter . . . team of horses.,
虎,tiger,"The kanji in this frame recalls the famous Bengali fable about the group of magicians (the _magic wand_ ) who decided to make a **tiger**. It seems that each of them knew how to make one part of the beast, so they pooled their talents and brought all the pieces ( _diced_ into pieces) together, at which point the fabricated **_tiger_** promptly ate its makers up (the bodiless _human legs_ ). Whatever the parable's significance for modern civilization and its arsenals, it should help with this kanji. Oh yes, we should not forget that cliff-like element. Think of it as an abbreviation of the primitive for _zoo_ (the first and fourth strokes, actually), in order to fit the **tiger** somewhere into the picture. In fact, the abbreviation is perfectly logical, since the bottom elements usurp the room for the rest of the primitive for _zoo_.","* As a primitive element itself, the _human legs_ are also swallowed up, but the meaning of _tiger_ is kept, and the whole serves as a roof for what comes beneath 虍, giving the _tiger_ something else to eat."

鹿,deer,"Drawn on the walls of a complex of _caves_ near Niaux in southern France are a number of animal likenesses dating from the Upper Paleolithic period. Among them we find pictures of **deer** , some of them showing men in **deer** masks. By _comparing_ their drawings to real **deer** , Stone Age people hoped to acquire power over the animal in the hunt, and by _comparing_ themselves to the **deer** , to take on that animal's characteristics. But time has locked with a ""double- _key_ "" (the extra stroke through the element for _key_ ) the real secret of this art form from us, and we can only surmise such meanings. But more important than the enigmas of the troglodytic mind is the way in which _caves_ , a double- _key_ , and _comparing_ gives us the kanji for **deer**.","* As a primitive, this kanji is abbreviated much the same as the _tiger_ was: the lower element is dropped to leave room for a replacement. Its meaning, however, remains the same. There are a very few cases (see frame 2158) in which there is no abbreviation. When this happens, we may keep the image suggested by the above explanation: _painting of a deer_."
麓,foot of a mountain,Grove . . . deer.,

慶,jubilation,"_Deer_ . . . _crown_ (note the doubling up) . . . _heart_ . . . _walking legs_. You may recall that we met the relative primitives at the bottom here before, in the kanji for _melancholy_ (Frame 663).",
麗,lovely,"The painting of a _deer_ itself with its form and color is enough to fill the bill for an image of something **lovely**. But to give a bit of contrast, we see two _mediocre_ drawings from a later age on two patches of _ceiling_ above. Note that the drop in _mediocre_ has been lengthened somewhat and the second stroke drawn down straight.",
